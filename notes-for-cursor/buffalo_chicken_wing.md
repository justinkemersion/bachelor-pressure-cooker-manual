## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
**What You're Doing:** Cooking the chicken in a savory garlic broth. **Note: We do NOT add the hot sauce yet.**

1.  **Add Liquid & Spices:** Pour **2 cups Broth** into the pot. Add **1 tsp Garlic Powder**, **1 tsp Onion Powder**, **1 tsp Smoked Paprika**.
   *   *Chemistry:* If we added the hot sauce now, the vinegar would toughen the rice grains in Phase 2. We keep the broth neutral for now.
2.  **Insert Trivet:** Place rack in pot.
3.  **Add Chicken:** Place thighs on trivet.
4.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) or **14 mins** (Frozen).
5.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
**What You're Doing:** Cooking the rice with the veggies.

1.  **Remove Chicken:** Move chicken to a plate. Cover with foil.
2.  **Add Rice:** Pour **1.5 cups rinsed rice** into the broth.
3.  **Add Veg:** Dump **1 cup Frozen Veggie Mix** (Onion/Celery/Pepper) on top. **Do not stir.**
4.  **Pressure Cook:** **5 mins** High Pressure.
5.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Mandatory.**
6.  **Shred:** While rice cooks, shred the chicken with two forks.

### Phase 3: The "Buffalo" Transformation
**What You're Doing:** This is where the magic happens. We turn plain rice and chicken into "Buffalo" style using the heat of the pot.

1.  **Open & Fluff:** Open the lid. Fluff the rice/veg mix.
2.  **Add Chicken:** Dump the shredded chicken back in.
3.  **The Acid:** Pour in **1/3 cup Hot Sauce**. (Use less if you hate spice, more if you love it).
4.  **The Butter Mount:** Drop in **2 tbsp Cold Butter**.
5.  **Stir Vigorously:** Stir the rice/chicken/sauce mix rapidly for 30 seconds.
   *   *Why?* The cold butter melts into the hot sauce and broth, emulsifying into a creamy, orange "Wing Sauce" that coats every grain of rice.

## 📦 Meal Prep & Storage

### Storage
- **Fridge:** 3-4 days. This recipe stores incredibly well because the butter fat protects the rice from drying out.

### Universal Reheating
1.  **Liquid:** Splash of **Water**.
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar.
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7**.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a fresh splash of **Hot Sauce** to wake up the vinegar kick.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes
*   **Acid vs. Starch:** Rice cooks by absorbing water. Acid (vinegar in hot sauce) strengthens the pectin in plant cells, making it harder for the rice to absorb water. If you cooked the rice *in* the hot sauce, you'd get crunchy, undercooked rice centers. Adding it at the end solves this.
*   **The "Butter Mount":** In French cooking, this is *Monter au Beurre*. Fat molecules in butter are suspended in milk solids. When you stir cold butter into a hot liquid, it thickens the liquid slightly and adds a glossy, velvet mouthfeel that oil cannot replicate.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Too Spicy?** You added too much hot sauce. Fix it by stirring in a little more butter or a splash of water.
*   **Not Spicy Enough?** Add more hot sauce to your individual bowl.
*   **Rice Crunchy?** You might have had some hot sauce residue in the pot or not enough liquid. Add 1/4 cup water, stir, and let sit on "Keep Warm" with the lid on for 5 mins.
