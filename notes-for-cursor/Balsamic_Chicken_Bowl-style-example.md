## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
1.  **Dump** broth and seasonings into the pot. Stir once.
2.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **12 mins** (Frozen).
4.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.
5.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Squeeze 1 lime** over it immediately. Cover with foil.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
1.  **Add Rice** directly into the flavored liquid remaining in the pot.
2.  **Add Beans** on top of the rice. **Do not stir.**
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure.
4.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Do not skip—this sets the starch.**
5.  **Prep:** While rice cooks, shred/slice your resting chicken.

### Phase 3: The Finish
1.  **Open & Fluff:** Use a fork to mix the beans and rice.
2.  **The Final Drizzle:** Squeeze the **2nd lime** over everything. 
3.  **High Notes:** Add a heavy hit of **cracked black pepper** and cilantro.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **The 1:1 + Splash:** We start with 1.75 cups of liquid because the rice needs 1.5. The extra 0.25 accounts for the tiny bit of steam lost during the first release.
*   **The Resting Lime:** Squeezing lime on the chicken *while it rests* forces the acid into the meat fibers rather than just sitting on top.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Use exactly 1.75 cups next time.
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
