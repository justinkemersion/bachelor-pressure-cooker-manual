This is a strong draft, but as your "Senior Sous-Chef," I need to point out a potential **"Logic Error"** regarding the liquid and the "Sequential Method."

Your intuition is correct: **Pressure cookers are closed systems.** Unlike a stovetop, almost zero liquid evaporates during the pressurized phase. In fact, chicken thighs actually *release* about 1/4 cup of juice as they cook.

If you start with 3 cups of broth and only use 1.5 cups of rice, you will likely end up with **"Burrito Soup"** or mushy rice.

Here is my technical review and a "Refactored" version for your manual.

### 1. The "Liquid Logic" Bug
*   **The Issue:** You suggested 2.5–3 cups of broth. Basmati in a pressure cooker requires a **1:1 ratio**. If you have 1.5 cups of rice, you need exactly 1.5 cups of liquid. 
*   **The Reality:** During the chicken phase, you lose maybe 2 tablespoons of steam during the release. But the chicken *adds* liquid. 
*   **The Fix:** Start with **1.75 cups** of liquid. This gives you 1.5 for the rice and a 0.25 "buffer" for the steam loss.

### 2. The "Late-Stage Drizzle" Check
*   **Acid Choice:** Cursor chose **Lime**. This is correct. Balsamic would have been a "Code Smell" here.
*   **Optimization:** Tell the bachelor to drizzle the lime onto the **chicken while it rests**, not just the rice. This allows the acid to penetrate the meat fibers.

### 3. Print-Ready Refactor (The "One-Page" version)
I have condensed this to fit on one laminated sheet while keeping your "Bachelor Confidence Boosters."

# 03_Recipes: Chipotle-Style Burrito Bowl (v2.0)
**Profile:** Tex-Mex | **Hardware:** Trivet Required | **Method:** Sequential One-Pot

---

## 🛒 Ingredients
- [ ] **1.5 lbs** Chicken Thighs (Thawed or Frozen)
- [ ] **1.5 cups** White Basmati Rice (Rinsed thoroughly)
- [ ] **1.75 cups** Chicken Broth (The "Logic" constant)

## ⚡ Phase 1: The Protein Cook
1.  **Pour 1.75 cups broth** into the pot. Stir in your **Seasonings**.
2.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken thighs on top of the trivet (keeping them out of the broth).
3.  **Pressure Cook:** 
    *   **Thawed:** 8 mins HP.
    *   **Frozen:** 12 mins HP.
4.  **Release:** 10 mins Natural Release (NR), then vent.
5.  **The Rest:** Remove chicken to a plate. **Drizzle immediately with the juice of 1 lime.** Cover with foil.

## 🍚 Phase 2: The Flavor-Wash Rice
1.  **Check Liquid:** You should still see roughly the same amount of broth. If it looks very low, add a splash more to hit the 1.5-cup mark (eyeball it to the rice level).
2.  **Add Rice:** Pour **1.5 cups rinsed Basmati** directly into the flavored broth. 
3.  **Add Beans:** Dump the beans on top of the rice (do not stir deep, just a light pat down).
4.  **Pressure Cook:** 6 mins HP.
5.  **Release:** 10 mins NR. This is the "Starch Set" phase. **Do not skip.**

---

## 🍋 Phase 3: The Bachelor Finish
1.  **Shred:** While rice finishes, shred or slice your rested chicken. 
2.  **Combine:** Open the pot, fluff the rice/bean mix. 
3.  **The Final Drizzle:** Add the sliced chicken back in or serve on top. Hit the whole bowl with the **second lime** and **cracked pepper**.
4.  **Chemistry Note:** The lime cuts the chicken fat; the pepper adds "high notes" that pressure cooking usually kills.

---

## 📖 Glossary Logic (Reference)
*   **Frozen Adjustment:** +4 minutes to Meat Phase.
*   **Basmati Ratio:** 1:1 (Rice to Liquid).
*   **The "Fond":** If you want more flavor, Sauté the chicken for 2 mins per side *before* adding broth, then scrape the bottom (Deglaze) before Phase 1.

### Why this version is better for your project:
1.  **Liquid Precision:** It removes the "evaporation fear" which often leads to soggy rice.
2.  **Resting Logic:** It uses the time the rice is cooking to let the meat rest, which is more efficient for a hungry bachelor.
3.  **Formatting:** It’s punchy and fits on a single side of a 3-ring binder page.

**What do you think of the 1.75 cup liquid adjustment?** If you’re nervous about it, we can call it "The 1:1 + Splash Rule."
