## High-Contrast Cook Time Table

| Ingredient | State | Pressure Time | Release | Bachelor Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chicken Thighs** | Thawed | **8 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Always 10m Natural Release. Rest 5 mins after removal. |
| **Chicken Thighs** | Frozen | **12-15 mins** HP | **10m NR** | **12m is minimum.** Larger pieces may need 15m. Always 10m NR. |
| **Chicken Cutlets** | Thawed | **4-6 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Thin pieces - cook fast! Watch for dryness. |
| **Chicken Cutlets** | Frozen | **8-10 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Add 4 mins to thawed time. Can dry out - check doneness. |
| **Chicken Breast** | Thawed | **6-8 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Can dry out easily. Rest 5 mins after removal. |
| **Chicken Breast** | Frozen | **10-12 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Add 4 mins to thawed time. Watch for dryness. |
| **Chicken Drums** | Thawed | **10-12 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Bone-in adds flavor. Rest 5 mins after removal. |
| **Chicken Drums** | Frozen | **12-15 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Add 2-4 mins to thawed time. Always 10m NR. |
| **Basmati Rice** | Rinsed | **6 mins** HP | **10m NR** | 1:1 ratio. Use 2 cups liquid start for sequential cooking (tested & proven). |
| **Jasmine Rice** | Rinsed | **4 mins** HP | **10m NR** | 1:1 ratio. Faster than Basmati. Use 2 cups liquid start for sequential cooking. |
| **Long Grain White** | Rinsed | **5 mins** HP | **10m NR** | 1:1 ratio. Works great! More budget-friendly than Basmati. Use 2 cups liquid start for sequential cooking. |
| **Canned Beans** | Any type | N/A | N/A | Add with rice in Phase 2. No extra time needed. |
| **Black/Pinto/White/Navy** | Soaked | **8-10m** HP | **15m NR** | Standard timing. "Soaked" = rehydrated in water 8-12hrs (or 1hr quick soak). |
| **Kidney Beans** | Soaked | **10-12m** HP | **15m NR** | Longer cook time. Must be soaked first. |
| **Chickpeas (Garbanzo)** | Soaked | **15-20m** HP | **15m NR** | Much longer - different timing. Must be soaked first. |

## Critical Rules

### The 10-Minute Natural Release
**Always wait 10 minutes** after pressure cooking before quick releasing remaining pressure. This "Starch Set" phase is essential for:
- **Rice:** Prevents mushiness, sets texture
- **Chicken:** Prevents rubbery texture
- **Never skip** - even if you're in a hurry

### The "Burn-Proof" 1:1 + Buffer (2 Cups)
**For sequential cooking (protein then rice):**
- **Start with 2 cups** liquid for 1.5 cups rice
- **Tested and proven:** The initiation recipe uses 2 cups liquid for 1.5 cups rice - this ratio works perfectly
- **Rice needs 1.5 cups:** The rice will absorb what it needs (1:1 ratio), and you'll have extra liquid for glazes/sauces
- **The extra 0.5 cups provides a buffer** to prevent burning and ensures the rice has enough liquid
- **Too much liquid = mushy rice** - but 2 cups is the tested sweet spot for sequential cooking

### Frozen vs. Thawed
- **Frozen protein:** Add 4 minutes to thawed time (12m minimum, up to 15m for larger pieces)
- **Frozen veggies:** Can add directly, no time change
- **Always check state** before setting timer
- **With 10m NR:** The natural release continues cooking, so 12m HP + 10m NR = safe minimum

## Quick Lookup

**Need rice timing?** → Basmati: 6m | Long Grain: 5m | Jasmine: 4m | Always 10m NR  
**Need chicken timing?** → Thighs: 8m (thawed) / 12-15m (frozen) | Cutlets: 4-6m / 8-10m | Breast: 6-8m / 10-12m | Drums: 10-12m / 12-15m | Always 10m NR  
**Need bean timing?** → Canned: No time (add with rice) | Soaked: 8-10m (most beans) / 10-12m (kidney) / 15-20m (chickpeas) | Always 15m NR  
**Need liquid amount?** → 2 cups start for sequential cooking (tested & proven)  
**Need release time?** → Always 10m Natural Release (never skip!)
