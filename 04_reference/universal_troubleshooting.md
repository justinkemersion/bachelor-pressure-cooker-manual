## Rice Issues

### Rice is Crunchy (Undercooked)
**Symptom:** Rice grains are hard, not fully cooked
**Fix:** Add **1/4 cup water**, **2 mins HP**, **Quick Release**
**Why:** Rice needs more liquid and time to finish cooking
**Prevention:** Check that you used the correct liquid amount (1:1 ratio for rice)

### Rice is Mushy (Overcooked)
**Symptom:** Rice is soft, sticky, or blown out
**Fix:** Too much liquid. Check that you used the **exact liquid amount** specified (not more)
**Why:** Too much liquid = rice absorbs too much = mushy texture
**Prevention:** Measure liquid exactly. Don't overcompensate for "evaporation" - pressure cookers are closed systems

### Rice Stuck to Bottom (Socarrat)
**Symptom:** Toasted/browned rice at the bottom of the pot
**Fix:** **Don't panic!** This is actually delicious. Scrape the bottom and mix it in - it's a Spanish technique called "Socarrat"
**Why:** Can happen if heat was too high or if there was a burn error
**Prevention:** Use correct liquid amounts, don't skip the natural release

## Chicken Issues

### Chicken is Dry
**Symptom:** Chicken is tough, rubbery, or lacks moisture
**Fix:** You skipped the **5-minute rest**. Always rest chicken after cooking
**Why:** Resting allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat
**Prevention:** Never skip the rest - it's mandatory for juicy chicken

### Frozen Chicken Not Done
**Symptom:** Chicken is still pink in the center after cooking
**Fix:** Add **2-4 mins HP**, **10m NR**, check again. If still pink, add more time
**Why:** Frozen chicken needs more time (12-15 mins minimum vs. 8 mins for thawed)
**Prevention:** Always check if chicken is thawed or frozen before setting timer

### Chicken is Rubbery
**Symptom:** Chicken has a tough, rubbery texture
**Fix:** You overcooked or used Quick Release when you should've used Natural Release
**Why:** Quick Release can cause proteins to seize up, creating rubbery texture
**Prevention:** Always use Natural Release (10m NR) for chicken, never Quick Release

### Chicken Shrinkage
**Symptom:** 4 thighs looked like a lot, but now they seem small
**Fix:** This is normal! After cooking, chicken shrinks but perfectly balances with 1.5 cups of rice
**Why:** Chicken loses water during cooking (rendering)
**Prevention:** This is expected - the ratio is correct

## Pressure Cooker Issues

### Burn Error
**Symptom:** Pressure cooker displays "BURN" error
**Fix:** **Don't panic!** This can create **Socarrat** (toasted rice bottom) - scrape the bottom and mix it in. Soak the pot in hot soapy water for 20m post-meal
**Why:** Usually caused by not enough liquid or food stuck to bottom
**Prevention:** Use correct liquid amounts, deglaze after searing, scrape bottom before pressure cooking

### No Trivet
**Symptom:** You don't have a trivet (rack) for the chicken
**Fix:** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick
**Why:** Chicken needs to sit above liquid, not submerged
**Prevention:** Always have a trivet (or know the foil trick)

## Ingredient Substitutions

### No Individual Spices?
**Fix:** Use **1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** - works great!
**Why:** Spice packets contain the same spices, just pre-mixed
**Prevention:** Start with spice packets, gradually build individual spice collection

### No Fresh Herbs?
**Fix:** Skip them - recipes work fine without fresh herbs. Or use dried herbs (add during cooking, not after)
**Why:** Fresh herbs are "high notes" - nice but not essential
**Prevention:** Dried herbs work fine for most recipes

### No Fresh Acid (Lemon/Lime)?
**Fix:** Use **bottled lemon/lime juice** or **apple cider vinegar** - different but works
**Why:** Acid is essential for brightness, but fresh isn't required
**Prevention:** Keep bottled lemon/lime juice in fridge (lasts months)

## General Issues

### Undercooked Food
**Symptom:** Food isn't fully cooked (pink meat, crunchy rice, etc.)
**Fix:** Add **2-4 mins HP**, **10m NR**, check again. If still undercooked, add more time
**Why:** Timing may need adjustment based on your cooker, altitude, or food size
**Prevention:** Always check doneness before serving

### Bland Food
**Symptom:** Food tastes boring, lacks flavor
**Fix:** Check that you:
- Added salt (brings out all other flavors)
- Added acid drizzle after cooking (brightens flavors)
- Used correct seasoning amounts
- Let food rest (allows flavors to develop)
**Why:** Flavor comes from proper seasoning, acid balance, and resting
**Prevention:** Follow recipe seasoning amounts, always add acid drizzle
