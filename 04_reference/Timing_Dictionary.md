## High-Contrast Cook Time Table

| Ingredient | State | Pressure Time | Release | Bachelor Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chicken Thighs** | Thawed | **8 mins** HP | **10m NR** | Always 10m Natural Release. Rest 5 mins after removal. |
| **Chicken Thighs** | Frozen | **12-15 mins** HP | **10m NR** | **12m is minimum.** Larger pieces may need 15m. Always 10m NR. |
| **Basmati Rice** | Rinsed | **6 mins** HP | **10m NR** | 1:1 ratio. Use 1.75 cup liquid start (1:1 + Splash Rule). |
| **Jasmine Rice** | Rinsed | **4 mins** HP | **10m NR** | 1:1 ratio. Faster than Basmati. Use 1.75 cup liquid start. |
| **White Beans** | Canned | N/A | N/A | Add with rice in Phase 2. No extra time needed. |

## Critical Rules

### The 10-Minute Natural Release
**Always wait 10 minutes** after pressure cooking before quick releasing remaining pressure. This "Starch Set" phase is essential for:
- **Rice:** Prevents mushiness, sets texture
- **Chicken:** Prevents rubbery texture
- **Never skip** - even if you're in a hurry

### The 1:1 + Splash Rule (1.75 Cups)
**For sequential cooking (protein then rice):**
- **Start with 1.75 cups** liquid
- **Rice needs 1.5 cups** (1:1 ratio)
- **0.25 cup buffer** accounts for minimal steam loss
- **Pressure cookers are closed systems** - chicken adds ~1/4 cup juice
- **Too much liquid = mushy rice** - stick to 1.75!

### Frozen vs. Thawed
- **Frozen protein:** Add 4 minutes to thawed time (12m minimum, up to 15m for larger pieces)
- **Frozen veggies:** Can add directly, no time change
- **Always check state** before setting timer
- **With 10m NR:** The natural release continues cooking, so 12m HP + 10m NR = safe minimum
