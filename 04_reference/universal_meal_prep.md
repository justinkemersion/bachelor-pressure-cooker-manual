# Universal Meal Prep & Storage Guide

**Reference Document** - Storage and reheating guidelines that apply to all pressure cooker recipes.

**When to use:** After cooking any recipe, refer here for storage and reheating instructions. Some recipes may have recipe-specific notes (check recipe for those).

## Storage Guidelines

### Cooling
- **Cool quickly:** Don't leave at room temp > 2 hours
- **Portion immediately:** Divide into meal-prep containers while still warm (easier to portion)
- **Label with date:** Use masking tape or labels - write date + contents (e.g., "Chipotle Bowl - 1/15")
- **Prevents mystery food:** You'll know what it is and when to use it

### Refrigeration
- **Storage time:** Use within **3-4 days** maximum
- **Container choice:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md` for container recommendations
- **Vented lids:** Essential for safe reheating (allows steam to escape)

### Freezing
- **Individual portions:** Portion into individual zip lock bags (quart size)
- **Label everything:** Write date + contents on bag with permanent marker
- **Freeze flat:** Place bags on baking sheet, freeze flat (prevents sticking, saves space)
- **Storage time:** Use within **2-3 months** for best quality

## Universal Reheating Method

**The Bachelor's Go-To:** Works for all pressure cooker meal prep.

**This method is detailed in** `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` (Universal Microwave Reheating Method).

### Steps
1. **Add moisture:** Splash of **water** (prevents drying)
2. **Cover with lid:** If using original container, **place lid slightly off** (covers but vents - prevents explosion)
   - **Pro tip:** If using Rubbermaid Brilliance, flip the grey latches UP (vents steam perfectly)
3. **Microwave:** **3:30 minutes** on **level 7** (medium-high)
4. **Stir halfway** (if possible) for even heating
5. **Restore "high notes":** Stir in fresh herbs/spices after reheating (oregano, cracked pepper, etc.)

### Why This Works
- **Moisture prevents drying** - water prevents food from drying out during reheating
- **Vented lid** prevents pressure buildup (safety) while trapping steam
- **Level 7** prevents rubbery texture (gentler than high)
- **Fresh herbs/spices** restore brightness lost in storage

### Alternative Reheating Methods
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of water/broth, heat gently in pan, stir occasionally
- **Oven:** 350°F, covered, 15-20 minutes (add liquid)

## Reheating Tips by Component

### Rice
- **Always add moisture** (water) to prevent drying
- Rice can dry out in the fridge - the water splash restores moisture
- Stir halfway for even heating

### Chicken
- **Reheat gently** to avoid rubbery texture (Level 7, not high)
- Add moisture to prevent drying
- Restore with fresh herbs/spices after reheating

### Acids
- **Add fresh acid after reheating** (brightens flavors)
- Lemon/lime juice, vinegar - add after reheating, not before
- Restores the "brightness" lost in storage

### Herbs/Spices
- **Add fresh after reheating** - restores "high notes"
- Dried oregano, thyme, cracked black pepper - add after reheating
- Pressure cooking and storage dulls these flavors - fresh addition restores them

## Burrito/Taco Conversion

**Universal Tip:** Any bowl can become a burrito or taco!

### Method
1. **Warm a tortilla:** 20 seconds in microwave (or heat in dry pan)
2. **Add bowl contents:** Spoon your bowl onto the tortilla
3. **Wrap it up:** Fold and roll
4. **Works for ALL recipes** in this cookbook

### Freezing Burritos
1. **Cool filling first:** Let bowl contents cool before wrapping
2. **Wrap in tortilla:** Add filling, wrap tightly
3. **Place in zip lock bag:** Label with date
4. **Freeze flat:** Place on baking sheet, freeze flat (prevents sticking)
5. **Reheating:** Remove from bag, wrap in **damp paper towel**, microwave **2-3 mins** (flip halfway)
   - **The paper towel trick:** Absorbs excess moisture so tortilla stays soft, not soggy

## Container Strategy

**See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md` for complete container guide.**

### Quick Reference
- **Home use:** Rubbermaid Brilliance (Glass) - 3.2 Cup Medium
- **On-the-go:** Rubbermaid Brilliance (Tritan Plastic) - 3.2 Cup Medium
- **Golden Ratio:** 3.2 Cups fits 1.5 cups rice + 1 cup chicken + 0.5 cup beans/veg

## Recipe-Specific Notes

Some recipes have special storage/reheating considerations:
- **Glaze-based recipes** (honey garlic, teriyaki): Store glaze separately, warm before drizzling
- **Yogurt-based sauces** (Greek lemon): Store separately, add after reheating
- **Butter mount recipes** (buffalo): Reheat gently to maintain sauce consistency

**Check the recipe** for any recipe-specific storage/reheating notes.
