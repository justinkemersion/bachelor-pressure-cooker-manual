# Safety Check & Chemistry Logic

**Reference Document** - Extracted from the Initiation Recipe for quick lookup.

This document contains the complete safety checks and chemistry explanations that apply to all pressure cooker recipes. Reference this when you need to:
- Check if something is safe to eat
- Understand why a technique works
- Diagnose cooking issues

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)

*   **The 2-Cup Liquid Buffer:** We increased the broth to 2 cups. This prevents the "BURN" error caused by the starches in the beans and frozen veg. Rice still gets proper 1:1 ratio after chicken adds juice.
*   **The Habanero Infusion:** Removing the pepper before the rice phase gives you "Ambient Heat"—it's everywhere, but it's not a "landmine." Seeds removed = controlled heat.
*   **The Resting Lime:** Squeezing lime on the chicken *while it rests* forces the acid into the meat fibers rather than just sitting on top.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.
*   **Socarrat (The "Burn" Bonus):** If the bottom is toasted, it's flavor gold. Scrape and mix it in - it's a Spanish technique that adds incredible depth and texture. Frustrating cleanup, but brilliant flavor!

## 🚨 What to Worry About (Safety & Quality Check)

### Meat: Fully Cooked vs. Funky

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Chicken is white throughout** (no pink) - fully cooked
- **Internal temp 165°F+** (if you have a thermometer)
- **Juices run clear** (not pink/red)
- **Texture is firm** (not rubbery or mushy)
- **Smells normal** (chicken-y, not sour/off)

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Pink/red in center** - undercooked, unsafe
- **Slimy texture** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour/rotten smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Gray/green color** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Undercooked?** Add 2-4 mins HP, 10m NR. Check doneness - if still pink, add more time.
- **Rubbery?** You overcooked or quick-released. Next time: use correct timing, always 10m NR, rest 5 mins.
- **Funky smell?** Don't risk it - throw it out. Check your timing next time.

### Rice: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat (Even If Not Perfect):**
- **Slightly crunchy** - undercooked but edible. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, QR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good for bowls, just softer texture.
- **Socarrat (toasted bottom)** - edible and delicious! Scrape and mix in.

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Burned/black** - inedible, throw out
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Crunchy?** Undercooked. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
- **Mushy?** Overcooked or too much liquid. Next time: use exact 2 cups liquid, check timing.
- **Tracing back:** Check your liquid amount (should be 2 cups), rice timing (6m Basmati, 5m Long Grain), and that you did 10m NR.

### Beans: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Slightly firm** - undercooked but edible. Add 2-3 mins HP, 15m NR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good, just softer.
- **Creamy texture** - perfect!

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Hard as rocks** - severely undercooked, inedible
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Too firm?** Undercooked. If canned: they're fine, just add more time next time. If dried: didn't soak properly or need more cook time.
- **Too mushy?** Overcooked. Next time: reduce cook time or use canned (no extra time needed).
- **Tracing back:** Canned beans = no extra time. Dried beans = must be soaked first, then 8-10m HP, 15m NR.

### The Golden Rule
**When in doubt, throw it out.** Food poisoning isn't worth the risk. Better to remake than get sick.

### Quick Diagnosis Flow
1. **Check smell first** - if funky, throw out immediately
2. **Check color** - pink meat = undercooked, gray/green = spoiled
3. **Check texture** - slimy = spoiled, rubbery = overcooked (but safe)
4. **Check doneness** - meat should be white throughout, no pink
5. **Taste test** - if it tastes off, throw it out
