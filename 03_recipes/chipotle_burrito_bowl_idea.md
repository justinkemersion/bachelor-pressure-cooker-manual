## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
1.  **Dump** broth, seasonings, and **Habanero halves** into the pot. 
2.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **14 mins** (Frozen block).
4.  **Release:** 10 mins Natural Release (NR), then vent.
5.  **Clean Up:** Remove and **Discard the Habanero.** 
6.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Squeeze 1 lime** over it immediately. Cover.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
1.  **Add Rice** to the liquid. Add **Beans** and **Frozen Veg** **and/or a can or two of jalepenos or chilis (drained)** on top. **Do not stir.**
2.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure.
3.  **Release:** 10 mins Natural Release (NR). **Starch Set Phase—mandatory.**

## 📦 Meal Prep & Burrito Logic

### Universal Reheating (The "OJ Hack")
1.  **Liquid:** Add a **splash of Orange Juice** (or water) to the container. 
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar. 
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7** (prevents rubbery chicken).
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a pinch of oregano and fresh pepper.

### The Burrito Wrap Option
1.  **Warm:** Microwave tortilla for 20s to make it pliable.
2.  **Fold:** Bottom up, sides in, roll tight. **Tuck as you roll.**
3.  **Quick Freeze:** Cool filling first. Wrap in **Foil**, then into a Ziploc.
4.  **The Paper Towel Trick:** When reheating a frozen burrito, **remove foil and wrap in a damp paper towel.** Microwave 2-3 mins. The towel absorbs excess moisture so the tortilla stays soft, not soggy.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes
*   **The Habanero Infusion:** Removing the pepper before the rice phase gives you "Ambient Heat"—it's everywhere, but it's not a "landmine."
*   **The 2-Cup Liquid Buffer:** We increased the broth to 2 cups. This prevents the "BURN" error caused by the starches in the beans and frozen veg.
*   **Socarrat:** If the bottom is toasted, it’s flavor gold. Mix it in.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Burn Error?** Scrape the bottom and mix it in. Soak the pot in hot soapy water for 20m post-meal.
*   **Chicken Shrinkage:** 4 thighs may look like a lot, but after the render, they perfectly balance 1.5 cups of rice.
