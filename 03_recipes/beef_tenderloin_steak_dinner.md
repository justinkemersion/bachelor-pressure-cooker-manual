## Instructions

### Phase 1: Marinade & Prep (Crucial)
1. **Marinade:** Mix **Balsamic + Worcestershire**, Olive Oil, Garlic/Onion powder, Thyme, Smoked Paprika, Salt, and Pepper. Coat both steaks. **Let sit 30 mins at room temp.** (Cold steak cooks unevenly).
2. **The Cut (Mise en place):**
   - **Shallot:** Peel and mince finely.
   - **Serrano:** For low heat, use **1/2 pepper** or skip. If using it: slice open, scrape out **ALL** seeds/white ribs, mince the green flesh. **Wash hands immediately.**
   - **Set Up:** Place wine, broth, paste, and aromatics next to the stove.

### Phase 2: Pressure Cooker (Background Task)
1. **Load:** Standard Rice + Veggie setup (see `02_techniques/core_techniques.md`).
2. **Start:** Run the cycle. *Focus entirely on the steak now.*

### Phase 3: The Sear & Steam (Well Done Control)
1. **Heat:** Skillet on **Medium-High**. Add **1 tbsp oil**. Wait for shimmer.
2. **Dry & Sear:** Shake excess marinade off steaks. Sear **2-3 minutes per side** (Deep brown crust).
   - **Rule:** Don’t crowd the pan. If your skillet is small, sear 1 steak at a time.
3. **Steam Finish:**
   - Turn heat to **Low**.
   - Add **2 tbsp water/broth**.
   - **Cover immediately.** Steam for **3-4 minutes**.
   - **If you have a thermometer:** stop steaming at **125°F** (med-rare) or **130°F** (medium).
   - **Rest:** Remove steaks to a plate. **DO NOT CUT THEM.** Leave pan dirty.

### Phase 4: The Spicy Reduction
1. **Sauté:** Turn heat to **Medium**. Add **Shallot** and **Serrano** to the beef fat. Sauté **1-2 minutes**. Add **Garlic** for last 30 seconds.
2.  **Bloom:** Add **Tomato Paste** and **Oregano**. Fry paste for **45 seconds** (until dark red).
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in **Red Wine**. Scrape bottom of pan vigorously to dissolve fond. Boil **2 minutes** (remove alcohol smell).
4.  **Reduce:** Add **Beef Broth**. Boil **2-3 minutes** until syrupy.
5.  **The "Monte":** Turn off heat completely. Swirl in **Cold Butter** until glossy.
6.  **Brighten:** Squeeze **Lemon Wedge** (3-4 drops) into sauce.

### Phase 5: Plating
1.  **Serve:** Plate rice/veggies. Place steak.
2.  **Sauce:** Pour reduction over steak, ensuring shallot/pepper bits are visible on top.
3.  **Finish:** Garnish with a pinch of oregano (see **Finishing Garnish: Oregano** on the back side).

## 🧱 Lego Block Notes

**New Lego Block: The "Monte" (Monter au Beurre)**

**📚 Building on the Foundation**
This recipe bridges the gap between "Bachelor Chow" and "Date Night." We upgrade from frozen onions to **Shallots** because frozen onions release too much water, preventing the sauce from thickening properly.

**The Technique:**
"Mounting with Butter" means adding cold butter to a sauce *off the heat*. The butter emulsifies (mixes creamy) rather than melting into oil. This gives the sauce a glossy sheen and velvety mouthfeel that restaurant steaks are famous for.

---

## Storage & Reheating

**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

### Recipe-Specific Notes
- **Steak:** This is a "Day Of" meal. Reheating tenderloin usually results in gray, tough meat.
- **Leftovers:** If you must reheat, slice the meat cold and eat it on a salad, or flash-heat it in a pan for 30 seconds. Do not microwave the steak if possible.

---

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Maillard Reaction:** The high-heat sear creates complex flavor compounds on the surface.
- **Deglazing:** The wine dissolves the "fond" (brown bits), reclaiming the flavor stuck to the pan.
- **The "Gastrique" Effect:** We are balancing **Fat** (Butter), **Salt** (Broth), **Acid** (Wine/Lemon), and **Heat** (Serrano). This triggers all parts of the palate.
- **Emulsification:** Cold butter contains milk solids and water suspended in fat. Whisking it slowly into the sauce creates a stable emulsion (creamy) rather than a broken sauce (oily).

### Substitutions
- **No Shallot?** → Use the white part of a green onion, or 2 tbsp frozen onions (thawed and squeezed bone-dry).
- **No Red Wine?** → Use 1/2 cup total Beef Broth + **1/2 tsp Balsamic + 1/2 tsp Worcestershire** in the sauce.
- **No Serrano?** → Pinch of red chili flakes (add during the "Bloom" step).
- **No Real Butter?** → You can use Plant Butter (Avocado oil base), but the sauce will be less glossy.

## Finishing Garnish: Oregano (3 Ways, Ranked by Bachelor Effort)

**My suggestion:** Use **Palm Friction** on your rice + veggies to tie the whole plate together.

### 1) The “Palm Friction” Technique (Best for Dried)
If you’re using the standard jar of dried oregano:

1. Pour a generous pinch into the palm of your left hand.
2. Rub hard with your right thumb/palm in circles for **5–10 seconds**.

**Why:** friction warms + pulverizes the leaves, releasing aroma oils.

**Where:** dust the oregano “powder” over **white rice** and **veggies**.  
**Pro tip:** squeeze a little extra lemon on the veggies first (lemon + oregano = classic Greek profile).

### 2) The “Fry” (Since You Have the Pan Out)
If you want a tiny texture contrast:

1. After you pour out the sauce, toss a pinch of oregano into the residual hot fat.
2. Let it sizzle **10 seconds**, then scrape it onto the steak.

### 3) Fresh Oregano (The “Grocery Store Upgrade”)
If you see fresh oregano next to the shallots:

1. Buy it.
2. Pick the small leaves off the woody stem.
3. Scatter whole leaves over the steak + sauce.

Fresh oregano is stronger and peppery—great against rich butter sauce.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**For universal troubleshooting:** See `04_reference/universal_troubleshooting.md`

### Recipe-Specific Issues
- **Steak is tough:** Tenderloin has zero fat to hide cooking errors. If it's tough, you likely steamed it too long or didn't let it rest.
- **Sauce is bitter:** The garlic or tomato paste burned. Next time, add garlic later and keep the paste moving constantly.
- **Sauce is too spicy:** The Serrano seeds were left in. To fix: Stir in a splash of heavy cream or a pinch of sugar.
