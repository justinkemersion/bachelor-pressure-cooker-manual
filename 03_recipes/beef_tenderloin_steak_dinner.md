## Instructions

### Phase 1: Marinade & Prep
1.  **Marinade:** Mix Balsamic, Olive Oil, Garlic/Onion powder, Thyme, Smoked Paprika, Salt, and Pepper. Coat the steak. Let sit **30 mins** at room temp.
2.  **Serrano Prep:** Slice pepper open, scrape out white pith/seeds (this controls the heat), and mince the green flesh. **Wash hands immediately.**
3.  **Sauce Mise-en-place:** Have your wine, broth, tomato paste, and frozen onions ready by the stove.

### Phase 2: Pressure Cooker (The Background Task)
1.  Load Rice, Water, and Veggies (Standard method).
2.  Start the cycle. *You are now on the clock to cook the steak.*

### Phase 3: The Sear & Steam (The Meat)
1.  Heat skillet on **Medium-High**. Add 1 tbsp oil.
2.  **Dry & Sear:** Shake excess liquid off steak. Sear **2-3 mins** per side until dark brown crust forms.
3.  **The "Well-Done" Steam:**
    *   Turn heat to **Low**.
    *   Add a tiny splash of water/broth (1 tbsp).
    *   **Cover with lid immediately.** Steam for **3-4 minutes**.
    *   Remove steak to a plate. **Do NOT wipe the pan.**

### Phase 4: The Spicy Reduction (The Magic)
1.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Turn heat to **Medium**. Add **Frozen Onions**, **Frozen Garlic**, and **Minced Serrano** to the beef fat.
    *   *Note:* Cook for 2-3 minutes until the water from the frozen onions evaporates and they start to brown.
2.  **Bloom the Paste:** Push onions to the side. Add **Tomato Paste** and **Oregano** to the hot spot. Fry paste for **45 seconds** (until dark red). Mix it all together.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in **Red Wine**. Scrape the bottom of the pan vigorously to dissolve the fond (brown bits). Reduce for **2 minutes** (boil off the alcohol).
4.  **Add Body:** Pour in **Beef Broth**. Boil for **2-3 minutes** until slightly syrupy.
5.  **The Finish:** Turn off heat. Swirl in **Cold Butter**. Squeeze the **Lemon Wedge** (just a few drops).

### Phase 5: Plating
1.  Scoop Rice/Veggies.
2.  Place steak adjacent.
3.  Pour sauce over steak, ensuring the chunks of onion and pepper sit on top.

## 🧱 Lego Block Notes

**New Lego Block: Red Wine Pan Sauce (Deglaze → Reduce → Butter-Mount)**

**📚 Building on the Foundation**
This recipe introduces the concept of a **Reduction Sauce** with a "Mount" finish.

**Why Frozen Onions First?**
Because you are using frozen onions, they release water when they hit the hot pan. If you add the tomato paste at the same time, the paste will boil in onion water instead of frying in fat. You must sauté the onions until dry *before* adding the paste.

**Why Lemon & Butter?**
This is a technique called *Monter au Beurre*. The butter thickens the sauce and adds gloss. The lemon (acid) cuts through the heavy fat so the sauce doesn't taste like grease.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes

- **Frozen onions first:** They dump water. If you add tomato paste too soon, it boils instead of frying, and you lose depth.
- **Tomato paste bloom:** 45 seconds changes it from “tin can” to “restaurant.”
- **Wine reduction:** Boils off harshness and concentrates flavor. (It won’t taste like wine when done.)
- **Butter-mount:** Adds gloss + rounds edges. Plant/tub butter works, but cold real butter is the gold standard.
- **Serrano heat control:** Seeds/pith are the heat. Scrape them out for “date night” spice.

## Storage & Reheating

**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

### Recipe-Specific Notes
- **Steak**: Best day-of. If reheating, do low power in short bursts.
- **Sauce**: Reheats great. If it breaks, add a tiny splash of water and stir.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Recipe-Specific Issues
- **Sauce is too spicy:** You likely left the seeds in the Serrano. Next time, scrape them all out. To fix *now*, add a splash of heavy cream or more butter to mute the heat.
- **Sauce is too thin/watery:** You didn't boil it long enough. Turn the heat back on and let it bubble until it coats the back of a spoon.
- **Steak is tough:** Tenderloin is lean. If you steam it too long, it tightens up. Adhere strictly to the 3-4 minute steam time.
