## 🛒 Hardware & Variables

### The Essentials
- [ ] **Protein:** **1.5 lbs Chicken Thighs** (Boneless/Skinless, Thawed or Frozen) — *Can be thawed or frozen - see timing below.*
- [ ] **Base:** 1.5 cups White Rice (Basmati, Jasmine, or Long Grain White - see timing) — *Rinse until water runs clear (3-4 rinses).*
- [ ] **Liquid:** **2 cups** Chicken Broth — *The "Burn-Proof" 1:1 + Buffer. Can use water + bouillon cube if no broth.*
- [ ] **The Veg:** 1 cup **Frozen Pepper/Onion/Celery Mix** — *Authenticity Check: Wings are always served with celery. This mix is perfect.*

### The Seasonings (When & How to Use)

**Phase 1 Seasoning (Goes in the Cooking Liquid):**
- [ ] **1 tsp Garlic Powder** — *Umami depth*
- [ ] **1 tsp Onion Powder** — *Sweetness and depth*
- [ ] **1 tsp Smoked Paprika** — *Smoky depth (essential upgrade over regular paprika)*
- [ ] **1 tsp Salt** — *Brings out all other flavors*

**Optional Flavor Upgrades (Add to Phase 1):**
- [ ] **1 tsp Dried Thyme** — *The "Secret Weapon." Adds a savory, floral backbone that makes chicken taste richer.*
- [ ] **1-2 Bay Leaves** — *Adds background depth. Remove before Phase 2 (they're not meant to be eaten).*

**Phase 3 Finishing (Added After Cooking):**
- [ ] **The Heat:** 1/3 cup **Hot Sauce** (Frank's, Crystal, etc.) — *Use less if you hate spice, more if you love it.*
- [ ] **The Richness:** 2 tbsp **Butter** (Cold) OR **Country Crock Butter** (2 tbsp, the spread in a tub) — *Butter creates the best "Butter Mount" emulsion, but Country Crock Butter (the spreadable butter substitute) works great too. If you don't have either, regular olive oil works, but butter/Country Crock Butter is better.*

## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking the chicken in a savory garlic broth. **Note: We do NOT add the hot sauce yet.** The vinegar in hot sauce would toughen the rice grains in Phase 2.

1.  **Add Liquid & Seasonings:** Pour **2 cups broth** into the pot. Add **1 tsp garlic powder**, **1 tsp onion powder**, **1 tsp smoked paprika**, and **1 tsp salt**. *Optional upgrades: Add 1 tsp thyme and/or 1-2 bay leaves for extra depth.* **Stir once** to mix.
   
   *Why now?* Spices go in the liquid so they infuse the chicken as it cooks. The liquid becomes flavored broth for the rice later.

2.  **Insert Trivet:** Place the metal trivet (rack) in the pot. The chicken sits on top, not submerged. *No trivet?* See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

3.  **Add Chicken:** Place **chicken thighs** on the trivet, **don't submerge them** - they should sit above the liquid.

4.  **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **8 mins** if chicken is **thawed**
   - **14 mins** if chicken is **frozen** (12m is absolute minimum, up to 15m for larger pieces)
   
   *Why different times?* Frozen takes longer to heat through. The 10m Natural Release continues cooking, so 12m is the minimum safe time for frozen.

5.  **Release:** After cooking, **wait 10 minutes** (Natural Release). This is mandatory - it continues cooking and prevents rubbery texture. Then manually vent remaining pressure.

6.  **Clean Up:** Remove and **discard bay leaves** (if used). Flavor has infused into the liquid.

7.  **Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. Cover with foil. **Let rest 5 minutes** (while rice cooks).

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking the rice with the veggies. We keep the broth neutral (no hot sauce) so the rice cooks properly.

1.  **Check Liquid:** You should still have roughly **2 cups of flavored broth** in the pot. If it looks low, add a splash more broth or water. The rice needs liquid to cook.

2.  **Add Rice:** Pour **1.5 cups rinsed white rice** directly into the liquid. **Don't stir yet.**

3.  **Layer on Top (Don't Stir!):** 
   - Add **1 cup frozen veggie mix** (onion/celery/pepper) on top of the rice
   
   *Why layer, not stir?* Stirring can cause the rice to stick to the bottom and burn. Layering lets everything cook together without burning.

4.  **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **6 mins** if using **Basmati rice**
   - **5 mins** if using **Long Grain White rice**
   - **4 mins** if using **Jasmine rice**
   
   *Why different times?* Different rice types cook at different rates.

5.  **Release:** After cooking, **wait 10 minutes** (Natural Release). **This is mandatory** - it's the "Starch Set Phase" that prevents mushy rice. Then manually vent remaining pressure.

6.  **Prep While Waiting:** While the rice finishes (during the 10m NR), **shred or slice your rested chicken**. Use two forks or just pull it apart with your hands.

### Phase 3: The "Buffalo" Transformation

**What You're Doing:** This is where the magic happens. We turn plain rice and chicken into "Buffalo" style using the heat of the pot and the "Butter Mount" technique.

1.  **Open & Fluff:** Carefully open the pot (steam will escape). Use a fork to **gently mix** the veggies into the rice. Don't mash - just fluff and combine.

2.  **Combine with Chicken:** Add your **shredded chicken** to the rice/veg mix. Mix gently with a fork.

3.  **The Acid:** Pour in **1/3 cup hot sauce**. (Use less if you hate spice, more if you love it).
   
   *Why now?* If we added the hot sauce earlier, the vinegar would toughen the rice grains. Adding it at the end solves this.

4.  **The Butter Mount:** Drop in **2 tbsp cold butter** (OR **2 tbsp Country Crock Butter** - the spread in a tub).
   
   *Why cold butter?* Cold butter melts slowly, allowing it to emulsify properly with the hot sauce and broth. *Country Crock Butter?* Works great too - it's a butter substitute spread that behaves similarly to butter for the emulsion. Use it cold from the tub, just like butter.

5.  **Stir Vigorously:** Stir the rice/chicken/sauce mix rapidly for **30 seconds**.
   
   *Why?* The cold butter melts into the hot sauce and broth, emulsifying into a creamy, orange "Wing Sauce" that coats every grain of rice. This is the "Butter Mount" technique (Monter au Beurre).

6.  **Taste & Adjust:** Give it a taste. Need more heat? Add more hot sauce. Need less heat? Add more butter or a splash of water.

## 📦 Meal Prep & Storage

### Storage
- Cool quickly, portion into containers
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**
- This recipe stores incredibly well because the butter fat protects the rice from drying out.

### Universal Reheating
1.  **Liquid:** Add a **splash of water** to the container. 
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar. 
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7** (prevents rubbery chicken).
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a fresh splash of **hot sauce** to wake up the vinegar kick. *Why:* Restores high notes lost during reheating. Water prevents drying, fresh hot sauce restores the vinegar brightness.

**See `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method.**

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)

*   **Acid vs. Starch:** Rice cooks by absorbing water. Acid (vinegar in hot sauce) strengthens the pectin in plant cells, making it harder for the rice to absorb water. If you cooked the rice *in* the hot sauce, you'd get crunchy, undercooked rice centers. Adding it at the end solves this.
*   **The "Butter Mount" (Monter au Beurre):** Fat molecules in butter are suspended in milk solids. When you stir cold butter into a hot liquid, it thickens the liquid slightly and adds a glossy, velvet mouthfeel. **Country Crock Butter** (the spreadable butter substitute in a tub) works great too - it's designed to behave like butter and emulsifies well with hot sauce. Regular olive oil works but doesn't create the same creamy texture. Butter = best texture, Country Crock Butter = great texture + bachelor-friendly (no dairy, keeps in fridge), olive oil = works but less creamy.
*   **The 2-Cup Liquid Buffer:** We use 2 cups of liquid (same as chipotle recipe) to prevent the "BURN" error caused by the starches in the rice and frozen veg. Rice still gets proper 1:1 ratio after chicken adds juice.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** You might have had some hot sauce residue in the pot or not enough liquid. Add 1/4 cup water, stir, and let sit on "Keep Warm" with the lid on for 5 mins.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Check that you started with 2 cups (not more).
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 14m is recommended, but 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Too Spicy?** You added too much hot sauce. Fix it by stirring in a little more butter or a splash of water.
*   **Not Spicy Enough?** Add more hot sauce to your individual bowl.
*   **No butter?** Use **Country Crock Butter** (the spread in a tub - works great for the "Butter Mount" technique) or regular olive oil (works, but butter/Country Crock Butter is better).
*   **No trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.
