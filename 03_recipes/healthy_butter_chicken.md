## Instructions

### Phase 1: Bloom + Deglaze (Burn-Proof Setup)
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**. Add a little oil (or use part of the butter).
2. Add **onion**. Sauté **~3 mins** until soft.
3. Add **ginger/garlic** + **garam masala, turmeric, cumin, chili powder**. Stir **30 seconds** (don’t burn).
4. **Deglaze:** splash in water/broth and **scrape the bottom** until clean.

### Phase 2: Build the Sauce (Don’t Smear the Bottom)
1. Turn off Sauté.
2. Add chicken + tomato sauce + **1/2 cup water/broth**. Stir just enough to coat.
3. **Tip:** Thick tomato sauce can burn if it gets mashed into the bottom. Avoid aggressive stirring here.

### Phase 3: Pot-in-Pot (Rice Above, Sauce Below)
1. Place the **tall trivet** in the pot.
2. In an oven-safe bowl, combine **1 cup rinsed rice + 1 cup water + pinch of salt**.
3. Place bowl on the trivet. Lock lid.
4. **Pressure Cook:** **6 minutes HP**, then **10 minutes NR**.
5. Remove rice bowl + trivet. Fluff rice.

### Phase 4: Make it “Butter Chicken”
1. If sauce is thin, use **Sauté** for **2–4 mins** to reduce.
2. Turn heat **OFF**. Let sauce cool **2–3 mins**.
3. Stir in **Greek yogurt** + **1 tbsp butter** (whisk hard to emulsify).
4. Taste and adjust **salt**. If too sharp, add a **pinch of sugar/honey**.

## Storage & Reheating
**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

**Notes:**
- Store rice and chicken/sauce separately if you can (best texture).
- Reheat sauce gently; boiling can make yogurt-based sauces look grainy.

---

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes
- **Why PIP works:** thick sauces are the #1 burn trigger. Separating rice prevents starch + sauce from settling on the bottom.
- **Why yogurt works:** you get “creaminess” from protein structure/emulsion, not heavy cream.
- **Why you cool first:** yogurt curdles when the sauce is boiling.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
- **Burn notice?** You didn’t deglaze/scrape clean, or the sauce was too thick/dry. Add a splash of water/broth next time and don’t smear thick sauce on the bottom.
- **Curdled/grainy sauce?** Sauce was boiling when yogurt went in. Fix: whisk hard; worst case blend briefly.
- **Rice undercooked?** Use a metal bowl for best heat transfer; thick glass/ceramic may need +2 mins.
