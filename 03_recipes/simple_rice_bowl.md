# Simple Single-Serving Rice Bowl (v1.0)
**Profile:** Asian-Inspired | **Method:** Bowl-on-Trivet | **Total Time:** 20m

**🧱 New Lego Block: Bowl-on-Trivet Cooking**

**📚 Building on the Foundation** - Reference the **Initiation Recipe** (`chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`) for fundamentals (liquid ratios, safety checks, troubleshooting). This recipe focuses on what's new: **cooking rice in a separate bowl using steam** (perfect for single servings and keeping rice separate from other ingredients).

**What You're Learning Here:**
- **Bowl-on-Trivet Technique:** Cooking in a heat-safe bowl placed on a trivet (steam method)
- **Single-Serving Ratios:** Perfect 1:1 rice-to-water ratio for one person
- **Steam Cooking:** Using water in the cooker (not in the bowl) to generate steam
- **Simple Seasoning:** Using pre-made spice blends or individual spices for quick flavor

**Use This Technique In:** Any single-serving rice dish, keeping rice separate from proteins, meal prep for individual portions

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Prep (3 minutes)

1. **Rinse the Rice:** Place **1/2 cup rice** in a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse under cold water, stirring with your hand, until water runs clear (3-4 rinses). This removes starch so rice doesn't get gummy.

2. **Set Up the Bowl:** Place rice in a **heat-safe bowl** (ceramic, glass, or stainless steel - must be oven-safe). Add **1/2 cup water** to the bowl.

3. **Add Seasonings:** Add **1 tsp Everything Bagel seasoning** (OR individual spices: 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, salt) and **1/2 tsp extra sesame seeds**. Stir once to mix.

4. **Set Up the Cooker:** Place **trivet** (rack) in the bottom of the pressure cooker. Pour **1 cup water** into the cooker (NOT in the bowl - this creates steam). Place the bowl on the trivet.

### Phase 2: Pressure Cook (6 minutes HP + 10m NR)

1. **Lock the Lid:** Make sure the sealing ring is in place. Lock the lid, set valve to **Sealing**.

2. **Set to High Pressure:** Press **Manual** or **Pressure Cook**, set to **High Pressure**, set time to **6 minutes** (Basmati) OR **5 minutes** (Long Grain White).

3. **Wait for Pressure:** The cooker will take 5-8 minutes to come to pressure (you'll hear it hissing, then it will beep when ready).

4. **Natural Release:** Once cooking is done, **wait 10 minutes** (this is the Natural Release - NR). The timer will count down. **Don't touch anything** - let the pressure drop naturally. This is crucial for rice to finish cooking and set properly.

5. **Quick Release:** After 10 minutes, turn the valve to **Venting** (Quick Release - QR) to release any remaining pressure. Wait until the float valve drops (no more steam).

### Phase 3: Finish & Serve (2 minutes)

1. **Remove the Bowl:** Use **oven mitts** (the bowl will be hot!). Carefully lift the bowl out of the cooker.

2. **Fluff the Rice:** Use a fork to fluff the rice gently (don't mash it - just separate the grains).

3. **Add the Drizzle:** Drizzle **1 tsp low sodium soy sauce** over the rice. Start with 1 tsp - you can always add more. Stir gently to distribute.

4. **Taste and Adjust:** Taste the rice. Need more salt? Add a tiny bit more soy sauce. Want more sesame? Sprinkle a few more seeds on top.

5. **Serve Immediately:** This is best eaten fresh and hot.

## Storage & Reheating

**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

### Recipe-Specific Notes

**Single-Serving Rice Bowl:**
- **Best eaten fresh** - rice bowls are best right after cooking
- **If storing:** Rice can dry out in the fridge - add a splash of water when reheating
- **Reheating tip:** Add a fresh drizzle of soy sauce after reheating to brighten flavors

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works

**The Bowl-on-Trivet Method:**
- **Steam Cooking:** The 1 cup water in the cooker creates steam that surrounds the bowl
- **Gentle Heat:** Steam is gentler than direct contact - perfect for delicate rice
- **Perfect Ratio:** 1/2 cup rice + 1/2 cup water = perfect 1:1 ratio (no buffer needed for single serving)
- **Separate Cooking:** Keeps rice separate from other ingredients (useful for meal prep)

**The Seasonings:**
- **Everything Bagel Blend:** Garlic + onion + sesame + poppy = savory, nutty, aromatic
- **Sesame Seeds:** Add texture and nutty flavor (toasted flavor develops during cooking)
- **Soy Sauce (Post-Cook):** Adds umami and salt - adding after cooking preserves the flavor (soy sauce can become bitter if pressure cooked)

**Why 1:1 Ratio Works:**
- **Single serving = no buffer needed** - the rice absorbs exactly what it needs
- **No beans/veg to account for** - just pure rice, so exact ratio works perfectly
- **Steam method = less evaporation** - the sealed environment means less liquid loss

### Substitutions

- **No Everything Bagel seasoning?** → Use individual spices: 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, salt
- **No sesame seeds?** → Skip them - the Everything Bagel blend has some, or use poppy seeds only
- **Want more flavor?** → Add 1/4 tsp ginger powder to the bowl (Asian warmth)
- **Different rice?** → Adjust timing: Basmati = 6 mins, Long Grain White = 5 mins, Brown Rice = 22 mins
- **No heat-safe bowl?** → See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for alternatives (oven-safe ramekin, small stainless steel bowl)

### Scaling Up

**For 2 servings:**
- 1 cup rice + 1 cup water (in bowl)
- 1.5 cups water (in cooker for steam)
- Double all seasonings
- Same timing (6 mins HP + 10m NR)

**For 4 servings:**
- 2 cups rice + 2 cups water (in bowl)
- 2 cups water (in cooker for steam)
- Double all seasonings
- Same timing (6 mins HP + 10m NR)

## 🎨 Flavor Profile Variations

**Not in the mood for Asian flavors?** Swap out the Everything Bagel seasoning for different flavor profiles! The bowl-on-trivet method works with any seasoning - just change the spices and the finishing drizzle.

### Mediterranean/Italian Profile
**In the Bowl:**
- Replace Everything Bagel seasoning with: **1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp salt**
- Skip the extra sesame seeds (or use 1/4 tsp for texture)

**Finishing Drizzle:**
- Replace soy sauce with: **1 tsp red wine vinegar** (OR 1 tsp balsamic vinegar + tiny pinch of sugar)
- Optional: Sprinkle with **dried basil** or **parmesan cheese** after cooking

**Why It Works:** Oregano + thyme = Mediterranean base. Red wine vinegar adds brightness. Garlic + onion = umami foundation.

### Tex-Mex Profile
**In the Bowl:**
- Replace Everything Bagel seasoning with: **1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp salt**
- Skip the extra sesame seeds

**Finishing Drizzle:**
- Replace soy sauce with: **1 tsp lime juice** (OR 1 tsp lemon juice)
- Optional: Top with **fresh cilantro** after cooking

**Why It Works:** Cumin + chili powder = Tex-Mex signature. Lime juice adds brightness and cuts through the earthy spices.

### Simple Garlic & Herb Profile
**In the Bowl:**
- Replace Everything Bagel seasoning with: **1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp salt**
- Skip the extra sesame seeds

**Finishing Drizzle:**
- Replace soy sauce with: **1 tsp lemon juice** (OR 1 tsp olive oil for richness)
- Optional: Sprinkle with **black pepper** after cooking

**Why It Works:** Garlic + thyme = classic combination. Lemon brightens, or olive oil adds richness. Simple but delicious.

### The Golden Rule
**Don't mix profiles** - If making Mediterranean, don't add cumin. If making Tex-Mex, don't add balsamic. Pick one profile and stick with it for best results.

**Pro Tip:** Start with the Everything Bagel version (it's the most versatile), then experiment with other profiles once you're comfortable with the method!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**For universal troubleshooting (rice, chicken, pressure cooker issues):** See `04_reference/universal_troubleshooting.md`

### Recipe-Specific Issues (Bowl-on-Trivet Method)

*   **Bowl overflowed?** Bowl was too full or cooker water touched the bowl. Use a taller bowl or less water in cooker (3/4 cup instead of 1 cup).
*   **Rice stuck to bowl?** Let it cool slightly, then use a fork to gently scrape. Add a tiny bit of water if needed.
*   **Too salty?** You added too much soy sauce. Start with 1 tsp next time, taste, then add more if needed.
*   **Want more flavor?** Add 1/4 tsp ginger powder to the bowl (Asian), or try a different flavor profile (see Flavor Profile Variations section above).
*   **Not in the mood for Asian flavors?** Swap Everything Bagel seasoning for Mediterranean (oregano + thyme) or Tex-Mex (cumin + chili powder) - see Flavor Profile Variations section.
