## Instructions

### Phase 1: Prep
1. Rinse **1.5 cups Basmati rice** until water runs clear, set aside
2. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towel
3. Mix all dry seasonings in small bowl (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, paprika)

### Phase 2: Sear Chicken
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**
2. Add **1 tbsp oil**, wait for "HOT" indicator
3. Season chicken thighs with spice mix (both sides)
4. Sear chicken **2-3 minutes per side** (don't move until browned)
5. Remove chicken, set aside
6. Deglaze with **1/4 cup water**, scrape bottom (captures flavor)

### Phase 3: Cook Rice (PIP Method - Recommended)
**Why separate?** Prevents rice from becoming mushy and ensures perfect texture.

1. Add **1 cup water** to bottom of pot
2. Place trivet or steamer basket
3. In oven-safe bowl or silicone container: combine rinsed rice + **1.5 cups broth**
4. Place rice container on trivet
5. Place seared chicken on top of rice container (or in separate container if needed)
6. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for **8 minutes**
7. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes**, then quick release remaining

**Alternative (One-Pot - Faster but Lower Quality):**
- Skip PIP, add rice + broth directly to pot with chicken
- Cook **8 minutes HP**, **10m NR**
- *Note: Rice may be slightly softer, chicken may be slightly overcooked*

### Phase 4: Heat Beans (If Using)
1. After removing chicken and rice, add beans + **1/4 cup water** to pot
2. **Sauté (Low)** for **2-3 minutes**, stirring occasionally
3. Season with pinch of salt and cumin

### Phase 5: Finish & Serve
1. Remove chicken, let rest **2-3 minutes**, then slice/shred
2. Fluff rice with fork
3. **Drizzle chicken with 2-3 tbsp fresh lime juice**
4. Add fresh cilantro if available
5. Season with fresh black pepper
6. Taste and adjust salt if needed

### Assembly
1. Rice in bowl
2. Chicken on top
3. Beans (if using)
4. Toppings (sour cream, cheese, salsa, etc.)

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage
- Cool quickly (don't leave at room temp > 2 hours)
- Portion into meal-prep containers
- Store rice and chicken separately if possible (better texture)
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Reheating
- **Microwave:** Add **1-2 tbsp water or broth**, cover, **2-3 minutes** (stir halfway)
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of broth, heat gently, stir

### Reheating Tip
**Always add fresh lime juice after reheating** - brightens flavors that fade in storage.

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Cumin + Chili Powder:** Core Tex-Mex flavor base (survives pressure cooking)
- **Lime Juice (Post-Cook):** Cuts through chicken fat, brightens dish, essential for Tex-Mex
- **Searing First:** Builds fond (browned bits) = deep flavor, prevents rubbery texture
- **PIP Method:** Ensures rice stays firm, chicken doesn't overcook
- **Garlic/Onion Powder:** Universal base that works with Tex-Mex profile

### Substitutions

**No Lime Juice?**
- **Option 1:** Apple cider vinegar (different but works)
- **Option 2:** Lemon juice (slightly different flavor)
- **Note:** Lime is ideal for Tex-Mex, but acid is essential regardless

**No Cilantro?**
- Skip it (not essential, but adds freshness)
- Can use parsley (different flavor but adds green)

**No Chicken Broth?**
- Use water + **1 tsp Worcestershire sauce** (adds umami)
- Or just water (rice will be more bland)

**Different Protein?**
- **Chicken Breast:** Reduce to **6-8 minutes HP** (can dry out)
- **Frozen Chicken:** Add **2-3 minutes** to cook time
- **Beef:** Use **12-15 minutes HP** for chunks

**Want More Heat?**
- Add **1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne** to spice mix
- Or add hot sauce/salsa as topping

**No Cumin?**
- **Critical for Tex-Mex** - try to get it
- If absolutely unavailable: Use extra chili powder + pinch of coriander

## Quality Checkpoints

✅ **Chicken:** Should be tender, not rubbery (searing + correct timing)  
✅ **Rice:** Should be firm, not mushy (PIP method + exact ratio)  
✅ **Beans:** Should be creamy, not mealy (gentle reheating)  
✅ **Flavor:** Should be bright and balanced (lime juice essential)
