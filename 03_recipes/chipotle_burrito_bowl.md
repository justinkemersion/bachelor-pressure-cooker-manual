---

## Ingredients

### Protein
- [ ] **1.5 lbs** Chicken thighs (boneless, skinless, **thawed OR frozen**)
- [ ] **1 tbsp** Avocado or canola oil
- [ ] **OR:** Use pre-marinated frozen chicken from bulk prep (see `02_techniques/bulk_prep_and_freezing.md`)

### Rice
- [ ] **1.5 cups** White Basmati rice, rinsed

### Liquid (For Sequential Cooking)
- [ ] **1.75 cups** Chicken broth (or water) - **The "1:1 + Splash" Rule**
- [ ] **Note:** Pressure cookers are closed systems - minimal evaporation. Chicken adds ~1/4 cup juice. Start with 1.75 cups to end with ~1.5 cups for rice (1:1 ratio).

### Beans (Optional)
- [ ] **1 can** Black beans, drained and rinsed
- [ ] **1/4 cup** Water or broth

### Seasonings (Before Pressure)
- [ ] **2 tsp** Cumin
- [ ] **1 tsp** Chili powder
- [ ] **1 tsp** Garlic powder
- [ ] **1 tsp** Onion powder
- [ ] **1 tsp** Oregano
- [ ] **1 tsp** Salt
- [ ] **1/2 tsp** Paprika
- [ ] **OR:** Use **1 Taco or Fajita spice packet** (McCormick, Old El Paso, etc.) - see `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md`

### Late-Stage Drizzle (After Cooking)
- [ ] **2-3 tbsp** Fresh lime juice
- [ ] **Fresh cilantro**, chopped (if available)
- [ ] **Fresh black pepper**

### Optional Additions
- [ ] **Frozen pepper/onion mix** (no chopping needed - see `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md`)
- [ ] **Canned green chilis** (diced, drained) - secret flavor weapon
- [ ] **Canned chipotle in adobo** (use sparingly - very spicy)

### Optional Toppings
- [ ] Sour cream or Greek yogurt
- [ ] Shredded cheese
- [ ] Salsa or hot sauce
- [ ] Diced tomatoes

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Prep
1. Rinse **1.5 cups Basmati rice** until water runs clear, set aside
2. **If using thawed chicken:** Pat dry with paper towel
3. **If using frozen chicken:** No need to thaw (see timing adjustments below)
4. **If using pre-marinated frozen chicken:** Skip to Phase 3 (no searing needed)
5. Mix all dry seasonings in small bowl (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, paprika)
   - **OR use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** instead of individual spices

### Phase 2: Cook Chicken First (Sequential Method)
**Why this method?** Simpler than bowl-based PIP, chicken juices flavor the rice, each element gets proper timing.

**No Trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

1. **Mix spices into liquid:** Combine all dry seasonings (or 1 spice packet) with **1.75 cups broth** in pot
   - **OR use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** mixed into broth
2. **Add trivet** (or foil trivet) to pot
3. **Place chicken on trivet** (elevated above liquid)
   - **Thawed chicken:** Season with spice mix if not using spice packet in liquid
   - **Frozen chicken:** Can add directly (no seasoning needed if spices are in liquid)
   - **Pre-marinated frozen:** Add directly
4. **If using frozen veggies (peppers/onions):** Add to liquid now (they'll cook with chicken)
5. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **Thawed chicken:** **8-10 minutes**
   - **Frozen chicken:** **12-15 minutes**
6. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes**, then quick release remaining

### Phase 3: Remove Chicken & Drizzle (Rest While Rice Cooks)
1. **Remove chicken** - place on cutting board or plate
2. **Drizzle immediately with juice of 1 lime** - acid penetrates meat fibers while resting
3. **Cover with foil** (optional, but helps retain heat)
4. **Let chicken rest** - it will rest while rice cooks (efficient timing!)
5. **Check remaining liquid** in pot:
   - **Should have ~1.5 cups** remaining (chicken adds ~1/4 cup juice, minimal evaporation)
   - **If looks low:** Add splash more broth to hit ~1.5 cups (eyeball to rice level)
   - **Pressure cookers are closed systems** - you won't lose much liquid

### Phase 4: Cook Rice in Flavored Liquid
**The magic:** Rice cooks in liquid flavored by chicken juices and spices! **Chicken rests while rice cooks** - efficient timing.

1. **Add rinsed rice** to remaining liquid in pot (should be ~1.5 cups)
2. **Add beans** (if using) - drained and rinsed, dump on top of rice
   - **Don't stir deep** - just light pat down (beans will mix during cooking)
3. **Add canned chilis** (if using):
   - **Green chilis:** Drained, add to pot
   - **Chipotle in adobo:** Use sparingly (1-2 tsp) - very spicy!
4. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for **6 minutes** (Basmati timing)
5. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes** - this is the "Starch Set" phase. **Do not skip.**
6. **While rice cooks:** Shred or slice your rested chicken (it's been resting this whole time!)

### Phase 5: Finish & Serve
1. **Open pot** - rice should be done (chicken has been resting this whole time!)
2. **Fluff rice/bean mix** with fork
3. **Combine:** Add sliced/shredded chicken back in or serve on top
4. **The Final Drizzle:** Hit the whole bowl with **second lime** (juice of remaining lime)
5. **Add fresh cracked black pepper** - adds "high notes" that pressure cooking kills
6. Add fresh cilantro if available
7. Taste and adjust salt if needed

**Chemistry Note:** The lime cuts the chicken fat; the pepper adds brightness that pressure cooking usually kills.

### Assembly
1. Rice in bowl
2. Chicken on top
3. Beans (if using)
4. Toppings (sour cream, cheese, salsa, etc.)

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage
- Cool quickly (don't leave at room temp > 2 hours)
- Portion into meal-prep containers
- Store rice and chicken separately if possible (better texture)
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Reheating
- **Microwave:** Add **1-2 tbsp water or broth**, cover, **2-3 minutes** (stir halfway)
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of broth, heat gently, stir

### Reheating Tip
**Always add fresh lime juice after reheating** - brightens flavors that fade in storage.

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Sequential Cooking:** Each element gets proper timing (chicken 8-12 min, rice 6 min) - ensures quality
- **Chicken Juices Flavor Rice:** Chicken drips into liquid, rice absorbs that flavor - brilliant!
- **Spices in Liquid:** Infuses throughout, flavors both chicken and rice
- **Efficient Resting:** Chicken rests while rice cooks (no wasted time!)
- **Lime on Resting Chicken:** Acid penetrates meat fibers during rest (better than post-cook only)
- **Liquid Precision:** 1.75 cups start = 1.5 cups for rice (1:1 ratio) - prevents mushy rice
- **Closed System Logic:** Pressure cookers don't lose much liquid - chicken actually adds juice
- **No Bowl Needed:** Simpler than PIP method, easier cleanup
- **Garlic/Onion Powder:** Universal base that works with Tex-Mex profile

### Substitutions

**No Lime Juice?**
- **Option 1:** Apple cider vinegar (different but works)
- **Option 2:** Lemon juice (slightly different flavor)
- **Note:** Lime is ideal for Tex-Mex, but acid is essential regardless

**No Cilantro?**
- Skip it (not essential, but adds freshness)
- Can use parsley (different flavor but adds green)

**No Chicken Broth?**
- Use water + **1 tsp Worcestershire sauce** (adds umami)
- Or just water (rice will be more bland)

**Frozen Chicken?**
- **Add 4 minutes** to cook time (12 minutes HP instead of 8)
- **Skip searing** (can't sear frozen)
- **Works great** - slightly longer cook time
- **See bulk prep guide** for pre-marinated frozen option

**Different Protein?**
- **Chicken Breast:** Reduce to **6-8 minutes HP** (can dry out)
- **Beef:** Use **12-15 minutes HP** for chunks

**Want More Heat?**
- Add **1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne** to spice mix
- Or add hot sauce/salsa as topping

**No Individual Spices?**
- **Use 1 Taco or Fajita spice packet** (McCormick, Old El Paso, etc.)
- **See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md`** for spice packet guide
- **Still add lime juice post-cook** - packets don't replace acid

**No Cumin?**
- **Critical for Tex-Mex** - try to get it or use spice packet
- If absolutely unavailable: Use extra chili powder + pinch of coriander

**Liquid Amount Concerns?**
- **Start with 1.75 cups** - "The 1:1 + Splash Rule" (1.5 for rice + 0.25 buffer)
- **Pressure cookers are closed systems** - minimal evaporation during pressurized phase
- **Chicken adds ~1/4 cup juice** as it cooks
- **After chicken:** Should have ~1.5 cups remaining (perfect for 1.5 cups rice = 1:1 ratio)
- **If looks low:** Add splash more broth to hit ~1.5 cups (eyeball to rice level)
- **Too much liquid = mushy rice** - stick to the 1.75 cup start!

## Quality Checkpoints

✅ **Chicken:** Should be tender, not rubbery (rests while rice cooks + lime during rest)  
✅ **Rice:** Should be firm, not mushy (1.75 cup start = 1.5 cups for rice, 1:1 ratio)  
✅ **Beans:** Should be creamy, not mealy (cooked with rice in flavored liquid)  
✅ **Flavor:** Should be bright and balanced (lime on chicken + final drizzle)  
✅ **Liquid Logic:** Pressure cooker is closed system - minimal loss, chicken adds juice  
✅ **Timing Efficiency:** Chicken rests while rice cooks - no wasted time!
