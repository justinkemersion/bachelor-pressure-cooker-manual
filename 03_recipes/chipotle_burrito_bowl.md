## Instructions

### Phase 1: Prep
1. Rinse **1.5 cups Basmati rice** until water runs clear, set aside
2. **If using thawed chicken:** Pat dry with paper towel
3. **If using frozen chicken:** No need to thaw (see timing adjustments below)
4. **If using pre-marinated frozen chicken:** Skip to Phase 3 (no searing needed)
5. Mix all dry seasonings in small bowl (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, paprika)
   - **OR use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** instead of individual spices

### Phase 2: Cook Chicken First (Sequential Method)
**Why this method?** Simpler than bowl-based PIP, chicken juices flavor the rice, each element gets proper timing.

**No Trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

1. **Mix spices into liquid:** Combine all dry seasonings (or 1 spice packet) with **2.5-3 cups broth** in pot
   - **OR use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** mixed into broth
2. **Add trivet** (or foil trivet) to pot
3. **Place chicken on trivet** (elevated above liquid)
   - **Thawed chicken:** Season with spice mix if not using spice packet in liquid
   - **Frozen chicken:** Can add directly (no seasoning needed if spices are in liquid)
   - **Pre-marinated frozen:** Add directly
4. **If using frozen veggies (peppers/onions):** Add to liquid now (they'll cook with chicken)
5. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **Thawed chicken:** **8-10 minutes**
   - **Frozen chicken:** **12-15 minutes**
6. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes**, then quick release remaining

### Phase 3: Remove Chicken & Check Liquid
1. **Remove chicken** - place on cutting board or plate
2. **Let chicken rest 5 minutes** - critical for juicy chicken! (juices redistribute)
3. **Check remaining liquid** in pot:
   - **Should have ~1.5-2 cups** remaining (for 1.5 cups rice)
   - **If less than 1.5 cups:** Add more broth/water to reach ~1.5 cups
   - **If more than 2 cups:** That's fine, rice will be slightly softer (or remove some)
4. **Save any chicken juices** from resting plate - these are flavor gold!

### Phase 4: Cook Rice in Flavored Liquid
**The magic:** Rice cooks in liquid flavored by chicken juices and spices!

1. **Add rinsed rice** to remaining liquid in pot
2. **Add beans** (if using) - drained and rinsed
3. **Add canned chilis** (if using):
   - **Green chilis:** Drained, add to pot
   - **Chipotle in adobo:** Use sparingly (1-2 tsp) - very spicy!
4. **Stir gently** to combine (rice should be covered by liquid)
5. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for **6 minutes** (Basmati timing)
6. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes**, then quick release remaining

**Note:** Liquid will be hot from previous cook - that's fine! Rice timing stays the same.

### Phase 5: Finish & Serve
1. **Slice or shred chicken** (should be rested from Phase 3)
2. **Fluff rice** with fork (beans and chilis will be mixed in)
3. **Drizzle chicken with 2-3 tbsp fresh lime juice** (essential!)
4. **Add saved chicken juices** from resting plate:
   - **Drizzle over rice** for extra flavor
   - **Mix into bowl** when assembling
5. Add fresh cilantro if available
6. Season with fresh black pepper
7. Taste and adjust salt if needed

### Assembly
1. Rice in bowl
2. Chicken on top
3. Beans (if using)
4. Toppings (sour cream, cheese, salsa, etc.)

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage
- Cool quickly (don't leave at room temp > 2 hours)
- Portion into meal-prep containers
- Store rice and chicken separately if possible (better texture)
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Reheating
- **Microwave:** Add **1-2 tbsp water or broth**, cover, **2-3 minutes** (stir halfway)
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of broth, heat gently, stir

### Reheating Tip
**Always add fresh lime juice after reheating** - brightens flavors that fade in storage.

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Sequential Cooking:** Each element gets proper timing (chicken 8-12 min, rice 6 min) - ensures quality
- **Chicken Juices Flavor Rice:** Chicken drips into liquid, rice absorbs that flavor - brilliant!
- **Spices in Liquid:** Infuses throughout, flavors both chicken and rice
- **Resting Chicken:** 5-minute rest redistributes juices (prevents dry chicken)
- **Lime Juice (Post-Cook):** Cuts through chicken fat, brightens dish, essential for Tex-Mex
- **No Bowl Needed:** Simpler than PIP method, easier cleanup
- **Garlic/Onion Powder:** Universal base that works with Tex-Mex profile

### Substitutions

**No Lime Juice?**
- **Option 1:** Apple cider vinegar (different but works)
- **Option 2:** Lemon juice (slightly different flavor)
- **Note:** Lime is ideal for Tex-Mex, but acid is essential regardless

**No Cilantro?**
- Skip it (not essential, but adds freshness)
- Can use parsley (different flavor but adds green)

**No Chicken Broth?**
- Use water + **1 tsp Worcestershire sauce** (adds umami)
- Or just water (rice will be more bland)

**Frozen Chicken?**
- **Add 4 minutes** to cook time (12 minutes HP instead of 8)
- **Skip searing** (can't sear frozen)
- **Works great** - slightly longer cook time
- **See bulk prep guide** for pre-marinated frozen option

**Different Protein?**
- **Chicken Breast:** Reduce to **6-8 minutes HP** (can dry out)
- **Beef:** Use **12-15 minutes HP** for chunks

**Want More Heat?**
- Add **1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne** to spice mix
- Or add hot sauce/salsa as topping

**No Individual Spices?**
- **Use 1 Taco or Fajita spice packet** (McCormick, Old El Paso, etc.)
- **See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md`** for spice packet guide
- **Still add lime juice post-cook** - packets don't replace acid

**No Cumin?**
- **Critical for Tex-Mex** - try to get it or use spice packet
- If absolutely unavailable: Use extra chili powder + pinch of coriander

**Liquid Amount Concerns?**
- **Start with 2.5-3 cups** - accounts for evaporation during chicken cook
- **After chicken:** Check remaining liquid (should be ~1.5-2 cups)
- **Too little?** Add more broth/water to reach ~1.5 cups for rice
- **Too much?** That's okay - rice will be slightly softer, or remove some before adding rice
- **Hot liquid is fine** - rice can go into hot liquid, timing stays the same

## Version History
- **v1.0:** Initial recipe with PIP method for quality
- **v1.1:** Added one-pot alternative for speed
- **v1.2:** Clarified lime juice importance in reheating
- **v1.3:** Added frozen chicken option, trivet alternatives, resting/juices, spice packets, frozen veggies, canned chilis
- **v2.0:** Switched to sequential cooking method - simpler, chicken juices flavor rice, no bowl needed

---

## Quality Checkpoints

✅ **Chicken:** Should be tender, not rubbery (resting 5 minutes + correct timing)  
✅ **Rice:** Should be firm, not mushy (check liquid amount before adding rice)  
✅ **Beans:** Should be creamy, not mealy (cooked with rice in flavored liquid)  
✅ **Flavor:** Should be bright and balanced (lime juice essential)  
✅ **Juices:** Save and use chicken juices - they're flavor gold!  
✅ **Liquid Check:** Ensure ~1.5 cups remaining after chicken cook (add more if needed)
