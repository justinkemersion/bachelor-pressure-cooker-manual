## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
1.  **Dump** broth, seasonings, and **Habanero halves** into the pot. 
2.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **14 mins** (Frozen, **12m minimum**, up to 15m for larger pieces).
4.  **Release:** 10 mins Natural Release (NR), then vent.
5.  **Clean Up:** Remove and **Discard the Habanero.** 
6.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Squeeze 1 lime** over it immediately. Cover.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
1.  **Add Rice** to the liquid. Add **Beans** and **Frozen Veg** **and/or a can or two of jalapeños or chilis (drained)** on top. **Do not stir.**
2.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure (Basmati) OR **5 mins** (Long Grain White).
3.  **Release:** 10 mins Natural Release (NR). **Starch Set Phase—mandatory.**
4.  **Prep:** Shred your chicken while the rice finishes.

### Phase 3: The Finish
1.  **Open & Fluff:** Mix the beans/veg into the rice with a fork.
2.  **The Final Drizzle:** Squeeze the **2nd lime** over the pot. 
3.  **High Notes:** Add cracked black pepper and cilantro.

## 📦 Meal Prep & Burrito Logic

### Storage
- Cool quickly, portion into containers
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Universal Reheating (The "OJ Hack")
1.  **Liquid:** Add a **splash of Orange Juice** (or water minimum) to the container. 
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar. 
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7** (prevents rubbery chicken).
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a pinch of oregano and fresh pepper.

**See `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method.**

### The Burrito Wrap Option
1.  **Warm:** Microwave tortilla for **20s** to make it pliable.
2.  **Fold:** Bottom up, sides in, roll tight. **Tuck as you roll.**
3.  **Quick Freeze:** Cool filling first. Place each in **individual zip lock bag** (label with date).
4.  **Freeze flat** on baking sheet (prevents sticking).
5.  **The Paper Towel Trick:** When reheating a frozen burrito, **remove from bag and wrap in a damp paper towel.** Microwave **2-3 mins** (flip halfway). The towel absorbs excess moisture so the tortilla stays soft, not soggy.

**Pro Tip:** Freeze individual burritos = grab-and-go meals. Paper towel method is key - prevents soggy tortilla.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **The 2-Cup Liquid Buffer:** We increased the broth to 2 cups. This prevents the "BURN" error caused by the starches in the beans and frozen veg. Rice still gets proper 1:1 ratio after chicken adds juice.
*   **The Habanero Infusion:** Removing the pepper before the rice phase gives you "Ambient Heat"—it's everywhere, but it's not a "landmine." Seeds removed = controlled heat.
*   **The Resting Lime:** Squeezing lime on the chicken *while it rests* forces the acid into the meat fibers rather than just sitting on top.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.
*   **Socarrat (The "Burn" Bonus):** If the bottom is toasted, it's flavor gold. Scrape and mix it in - it's a Spanish technique that adds incredible depth and texture. Frustrating cleanup, but brilliant flavor!

## 🚨 What to Worry About (Safety & Quality Check)

### Meat: Fully Cooked vs. Funky

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Chicken is white throughout** (no pink) - fully cooked
- **Internal temp 165°F+** (if you have a thermometer)
- **Juices run clear** (not pink/red)
- **Texture is firm** (not rubbery or mushy)
- **Smells normal** (chicken-y, not sour/off)

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Pink/red in center** - undercooked, unsafe
- **Slimy texture** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour/rotten smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Gray/green color** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Undercooked?** Add 2-4 mins HP, 10m NR. Check doneness - if still pink, add more time.
- **Rubbery?** You overcooked or quick-released. Next time: use correct timing, always 10m NR, rest 5 mins.
- **Funky smell?** Don't risk it - throw it out. Check your timing next time.

### Rice: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat (Even If Not Perfect):**
- **Slightly crunchy** - undercooked but edible. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, QR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good for bowls, just softer texture.
- **Socarrat (toasted bottom)** - edible and delicious! Scrape and mix in.

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Burned/black** - inedible, throw out
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Crunchy?** Undercooked. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
- **Mushy?** Overcooked or too much liquid. Next time: use exact 2 cups liquid, check timing.
- **Tracing back:** Check your liquid amount (should be 2 cups), rice timing (6m Basmati, 5m Long Grain), and that you did 10m NR.

### Beans: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Slightly firm** - undercooked but edible. Add 2-3 mins HP, 15m NR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good, just softer.
- **Creamy texture** - perfect!

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Hard as rocks** - severely undercooked, inedible
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Too firm?** Undercooked. If canned: they're fine, just add more time next time. If dried: didn't soak properly or need more cook time.
- **Too mushy?** Overcooked. Next time: reduce cook time or use canned (no extra time needed).
- **Tracing back:** Canned beans = no extra time. Dried beans = must be soaked first, then 8-10m HP, 15m NR.

### The Golden Rule
**When in doubt, throw it out.** Food poisoning isn't worth the risk. Better to remake than get sick.

### Quick Diagnosis Flow
1. **Check smell first** - if funky, throw out immediately
2. **Check color** - pink meat = undercooked, gray/green = spoiled
3. **Check texture** - slimy = spoiled, rubbery = overcooked (but safe)
4. **Check doneness** - meat should be white throughout, no pink
5. **Taste test** - if it tastes off, throw it out

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Check that you started with 2 cups (not more).
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 14m is recommended, but 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Burn Error?** Don't panic! This can create **Socarrat** (toasted rice bottom) - scrape the bottom and mix it in. Soak the pot in hot soapy water for 20m post-meal.
*   **Chicken Shrinkage:** 4 thighs may look like a lot, but after the render, they perfectly balance 1.5 cups of rice.
*   **No trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.
*   **No individual spices?** Use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet - works great!
*   **No lime?** Use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (different but works).
