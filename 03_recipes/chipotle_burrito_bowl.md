## Instructions

### Phase 1: Prep
1. Rinse **1.5 cups Basmati rice** until water runs clear, set aside
2. **If using thawed chicken:** Pat dry with paper towel
3. **If using frozen chicken:** No need to thaw (see timing adjustments below)
4. **If using pre-marinated frozen chicken:** Skip to Phase 3 (no searing needed)
5. Mix all dry seasonings in small bowl (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, paprika)
   - **OR use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet** instead of individual spices

### Phase 2: Sear Chicken
**Skip this step if using frozen chicken or pre-marinated frozen chicken.**

1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**
2. Add **1 tbsp oil**, wait for "HOT" indicator
3. Season chicken thighs with spice mix (both sides)
4. Sear chicken **2-3 minutes per side** (don't move until browned)
5. Remove chicken, set aside
6. Deglaze with **1/4 cup water**, scrape bottom (captures flavor)

**Note:** If using frozen chicken, you can't sear first. Add directly to pot in Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Cook Rice (PIP Method - Recommended)
**Why separate?** Prevents rice from becoming mushy and ensures perfect texture.

**No Trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

1. Add **1 cup water** to bottom of pot
2. Place trivet, steamer basket, **or foil trivet** (see hacks guide)
3. In oven-safe bowl or silicone container: combine rinsed rice + **1.5 cups broth**
4. Place rice container on trivet
5. **If using thawed/seared chicken:** Place on top of rice container (or in separate container)
6. **If using frozen chicken:** Place frozen chicken directly in pot (or on trivet), add **2-4 minutes** to cook time
7. **If using frozen veggies (peppers/onions):** Add to pot now (they'll cook with everything)
8. Lock lid, set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **Thawed chicken:** **8 minutes**
   - **Frozen chicken:** **12 minutes** (adds 4 minutes)
9. **Natural Release** for **10 minutes**, then quick release remaining

**Alternative (One-Pot - Faster but Lower Quality):**
- Skip PIP, add rice + broth directly to pot with chicken
- Cook **8 minutes HP**, **10m NR**
- *Note: Rice may be slightly softer, chicken may be slightly overcooked*

### Phase 4: Heat Beans & Chilis (If Using)
1. After removing chicken and rice, add beans + **1/4 cup water** to pot
2. **If using canned chilis:** Add drained chilis now (green chilis or chipotle)
3. **Sauté (Low)** for **2-3 minutes**, stirring occasionally
4. Season with pinch of salt and cumin
5. **If using chipotle in adobo:** Use sparingly (1-2 tsp) - very spicy!

### Phase 5: Finish & Serve
1. **Remove chicken** - place on cutting board or plate
2. **Let rest 5 minutes** - this is critical! Allows juices to redistribute (prevents dry chicken)
3. **Save any juices** from chicken - these are flavor gold!
   - **Drizzle over rice** for extra flavor
   - **Mix into beans** if using
   - **Add to bowl** when assembling
4. **Slice or shred chicken** after resting
5. Fluff rice with fork
6. **Drizzle chicken with 2-3 tbsp fresh lime juice** (essential!)
7. Add fresh cilantro if available
8. Season with fresh black pepper
9. Taste and adjust salt if needed
10. **Add saved chicken juices** to bowl when assembling

### Assembly
1. Rice in bowl
2. Chicken on top
3. Beans (if using)
4. Toppings (sour cream, cheese, salsa, etc.)

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage
- Cool quickly (don't leave at room temp > 2 hours)
- Portion into meal-prep containers
- Store rice and chicken separately if possible (better texture)
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Reheating
- **Microwave:** Add **1-2 tbsp water or broth**, cover, **2-3 minutes** (stir halfway)
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of broth, heat gently, stir

### Reheating Tip
**Always add fresh lime juice after reheating** - brightens flavors that fade in storage.

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Cumin + Chili Powder:** Core Tex-Mex flavor base (survives pressure cooking)
- **Lime Juice (Post-Cook):** Cuts through chicken fat, brightens dish, essential for Tex-Mex
- **Searing First:** Builds fond (browned bits) = deep flavor, prevents rubbery texture
- **PIP Method:** Ensures rice stays firm, chicken doesn't overcook
- **Garlic/Onion Powder:** Universal base that works with Tex-Mex profile

### Substitutions

**No Lime Juice?**
- **Option 1:** Apple cider vinegar (different but works)
- **Option 2:** Lemon juice (slightly different flavor)
- **Note:** Lime is ideal for Tex-Mex, but acid is essential regardless

**No Cilantro?**
- Skip it (not essential, but adds freshness)
- Can use parsley (different flavor but adds green)

**No Chicken Broth?**
- Use water + **1 tsp Worcestershire sauce** (adds umami)
- Or just water (rice will be more bland)

**Frozen Chicken?**
- **Add 4 minutes** to cook time (12 minutes HP instead of 8)
- **Skip searing** (can't sear frozen)
- **Works great** - slightly longer cook time
- **See bulk prep guide** for pre-marinated frozen option

**Different Protein?**
- **Chicken Breast:** Reduce to **6-8 minutes HP** (can dry out)
- **Beef:** Use **12-15 minutes HP** for chunks

**Want More Heat?**
- Add **1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne** to spice mix
- Or add hot sauce/salsa as topping

**No Individual Spices?**
- **Use 1 Taco or Fajita spice packet** (McCormick, Old El Paso, etc.)
- **See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md`** for spice packet guide
- **Still add lime juice post-cook** - packets don't replace acid

**No Cumin?**
- **Critical for Tex-Mex** - try to get it or use spice packet
- If absolutely unavailable: Use extra chili powder + pinch of coriander

## Version History
- **v1.0:** Initial recipe with PIP method for quality
- **v1.1:** Added one-pot alternative for speed
- **v1.2:** Clarified lime juice importance in reheating
- **v1.3:** Added frozen chicken option, trivet alternatives, resting/juices, spice packets, frozen veggies, canned chilis

## Quality Checkpoints

✅ **Chicken:** Should be tender, not rubbery (resting 5 minutes + correct timing)  
✅ **Rice:** Should be firm, not mushy (PIP method + exact ratio)  
✅ **Beans:** Should be creamy, not mealy (gentle reheating)  
✅ **Flavor:** Should be bright and balanced (lime juice essential)  
✅ **Juices:** Save and use chicken juices - they're flavor gold!
