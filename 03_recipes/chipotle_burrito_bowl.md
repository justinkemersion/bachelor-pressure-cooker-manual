## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
1.  **Dump** broth and seasonings into the pot. Stir once.
2.  **Optional Habanero:** If using habanero, add **halved, seeds removed** to liquid now (removes before Phase 2).
3.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
4.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **12-15 mins** (Frozen, **12m minimum**).
5.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.
6.  **Remove habanero** (if used) - discard. Heat has infused into liquid.
7.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Squeeze 1 lime** over it immediately. Cover with foil.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
1.  **Add Rice** directly into the flavored liquid remaining in the pot.
2.  **Add Beans** on top of the rice. **Do not stir.**
3.  **Add frozen peppers/onions:** Handful of bagged frozen mix (no chopping needed!).
4.  **Optional Heat:** Add 1-2 cans chopped green chilis or jalapeños (drained). For serious heat: **1 habanero, halved, seeds removed** (add in Phase 1, remove before Phase 2 - perfect heat without overwhelming).
5.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure.
6.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Do not skip—this sets the starch.**
7.  **Prep:** While rice cooks, shred/slice your resting chicken.

### Phase 3: The Finish
1.  **Open & Fluff:** Use a fork to mix the beans and rice.
2.  **The Final Drizzle:** Squeeze the **2nd lime** over everything. 
3.  **High Notes:** Add a heavy hit of **cracked black pepper** and cilantro.

### Storage
- Cool quickly, portion into containers
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Reheating (Universal Method)
1.  **Add splash of OJ** (or water minimum) to container.
2.  **Cover with lid slightly off** (vents but traps steam).
3.  **Microwave:** **3:30 minutes** on **level 7** (medium-high).
4.  **Stir in:** Pinch of **oregano** + **cracked black pepper**.
5.  **Taste and adjust** - add fresh lime if needed.

**See `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method.**

## 🌯 Burrito Wrap Option

**Note:** Bowl contents = burrito filling. Wrap it up when you want the full experience (or meal prep frozen burritos).

### The Wrap Technique
1.  **Warm tortilla:** Microwave **15-20 seconds** (or heat in dry pan 30 seconds per side).
2.  **Assembly:** Place tortilla on plate. Add rice, chicken, beans, toppings in center (don't overfill!).
3.  **Fold:** Bottom up, sides in, roll tightly. **Tuck as you roll** - keeps it together.
4.  **Optional:** Wrap in foil for easier handling.

### Frozen Burrito Meal Prep (Quick Method)
1.  **Make burritos** using technique above (cool filling first).
2.  **Place each in individual zip lock bag** (label with date).
3.  **Freeze flat** on baking sheet (prevents sticking).
4.  **Reheat:** Remove from bag, **wrap in paper towel** (absorbs excess moisture), microwave **2-3 minutes** (flip halfway).

**Pro Tip:** Freeze individual burritos = grab-and-go meals. Paper towel method is key - prevents soggy tortilla.

### Frozen Burrito Meal Prep (Advanced - When You Have Time)
1.  **Make burritos** using technique above (cool filling first).
2.  **Wrap each in foil** (label with date).
3.  **Freeze flat** on baking sheet (prevents sticking).
4.  **Transfer to freezer bag** once frozen.
5.  **Reheat:** Remove foil, wrap in paper towel, microwave **2-3 minutes** (flip halfway). Or bake **350°F for 20-25 mins** (foil on).

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **The 1:1 + Splash:** We start with 1.75 cups of liquid because the rice needs 1.5. The extra 0.25 accounts for the tiny bit of steam lost during the first release.
*   **The Resting Lime:** Squeezing lime on the chicken *while it rests* forces the acid into the meat fibers rather than just sitting on top.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.
*   **The Habanero Technique:** Whole halves in Phase 1, remove before Phase 2 - infuses perfect heat without overwhelming. Seeds removed = controlled heat.
*   **Socarrat (The "Burn" Bonus):** If you get a BURN error, you've accidentally created socarrat - toasted rice bottom. Scrape and mix in - it's a Spanish technique that adds incredible depth and texture. Frustrating cleanup, but brilliant flavor!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Use exactly 1.75 cups next time.
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Got "BURN" error?** Don't panic! This can create **Socarrat** (toasted rice bottom) - a Spanish technique that adds amazing flavor. Scrape with wooden spatula and mix in - it's delicious! If you want to avoid it, add splash more liquid before Phase 2.
*   **No trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.
*   **No individual spices?** Use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet - works great!
*   **No lime?** Use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (different but works).
