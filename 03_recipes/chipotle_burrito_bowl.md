## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE CHEAT SHEET

**Need to remember something fast? Scan this section first.**

### Key Ratios & Numbers
- **Liquid to Rice:** 2 cups liquid for 1.5 cups rice (1:1 + buffer for beans/veg)
- **Chicken Timing:** 8 mins (thawed) / 14 mins (frozen, 12m minimum)
- **Rice Timing:** 6 mins Basmati / 5 mins Long Grain White
- **Release Time:** Always 10 mins Natural Release (NR) - mandatory for starch set
- **Rest Time:** 5 mins minimum for chicken (makes it juicy)

### Safety Quick Check
1. **Smell** → Funky? Throw out
2. **Color** → Pink meat? Undercooked. Gray/green? Spoiled
3. **Texture** → Slimy? Spoiled. Rubbery? Overcooked but safe
4. **Doneness** → White throughout? Good. Pink center? Keep cooking

### Common Fixes
- **Crunchy rice?** → Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, QR
- **Mushy rice?** → Too much liquid. Use exact 2 cups next time
- **Dry chicken?** → Skipped the rest. Always rest 5 mins
- **Undercooked?** → Add 2-4 mins HP, 10m NR, check again

### Abbreviations
- **HP** = High Pressure
- **NR** = Natural Release (wait 10 mins, then vent)
- **QR** = Quick Release (vent immediately)
- **10m NR** = Wait 10 mins natural release, then quick release

## 🛒 Hardware & Variables

### The Essentials
- [ ] **Protein:** **4 Chicken Thighs** (approx 1.75 lbs) — *Crucial for meal prep volume. Can be thawed or frozen - see timing below.*
- [ ] **Base:** 1.5 cups Basmati Rice (OR Long Grain White - see timing) — *Rinse until water runs clear (3-4 rinses). This removes starch so rice doesn't get gummy.*
- [ ] **Liquid:** **2 cups** Chicken Broth — *The "Burn-Proof" 1:1 + Buffer. Can use water + bouillon cube if no broth.*
- [ ] **Bulk:** 1 can Black Beans — *Drain and rinse. Canned beans are already cooked, so they just need to heat through.*

### The Seasonings (When & How to Use)

**Phase 1 Seasoning (Goes in the Cooking Liquid):**
- [ ] **Option A (Easiest):** 1 Taco/Fajita Seasoning Packet — *Just dump it in the broth. Done.*
- [ ] **Option B (From Scratch):** 
  - 2 tsp Ground Cumin — *Earthy, Tex-Mex base flavor*
  - 1 tsp Chili Powder — *Heat + flavor (not just heat)*
  - 1 tsp Garlic Powder — *Umami depth*
  - 1 tsp Salt — *Brings out all other flavors*

**Phase 3 Finishing (Added After Cooking):**
- [ ] **Acid:** 2 Fresh Limes — *Cut in half, squeeze over finished dish. Brightens everything.*
- [ ] **High Notes:** Fresh Cracked Black Pepper — *Use a pepper grinder or crack whole peppercorns. Adds brightness that pressure cooking kills.*
- [ ] **Fresh Herb:** Fresh Cilantro (optional but recommended) — *Chop leaves, sprinkle on top. Skip if you hate cilantro.*

### Optional Additions
- [ ] **Heat:** 1 Habanero (Halved, seeds removed) — *Adds ambient heat throughout. Remove before Phase 2. Use gloves when handling!*
- [ ] **Bulk Fill:** Frozen pepper/onion mix (handful) — *Adds volume and texture. No chopping needed!*

## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking the chicken in seasoned liquid. The chicken sits on a trivet (rack) so it steams, not boils. This keeps it tender.

1.  **Add Liquid & Seasonings:** Pour **2 cups broth** into the pot. Add your **seasoning packet** (or individual spices: 2tsp cumin, 1tsp chili powder, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp salt). **Stir once** to mix. If using habanero, add **halved, seeds removed** now (use gloves!).
   
   *Why now?* Spices go in the liquid so they infuse the chicken as it cooks. The liquid becomes flavored broth for the rice later.

2.  **Insert Trivet:** Place the metal trivet (rack) in the pot. The chicken sits on top, not submerged. *No trivet?* See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

3.  **Add Chicken:** Place **4 chicken thighs** on the trivet, skin-side up if they have skin. **Don't submerge them** - they should sit above the liquid.

4.  **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **8 mins** if chicken is **thawed**
   - **14 mins** if chicken is **frozen** (12m is absolute minimum, up to 15m for larger pieces)
   
   *Why different times?* Frozen takes longer to heat through. The 10m Natural Release continues cooking, so 12m is the minimum safe time for frozen.

5.  **Release:** After cooking, **wait 10 minutes** (Natural Release). This is mandatory - it continues cooking and prevents rubbery texture. Then manually vent remaining pressure.

6.  **Clean Up:** Remove and **discard the habanero** (if used). The heat has infused into the liquid.

7.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Cut 1 lime in half and squeeze it over the chicken immediately.** Cover with foil or a plate. Let rest 5 minutes.
   
   *Why squeeze lime now?* The acid penetrates the meat fibers while it's hot, cutting through fat and adding depth. Resting makes the chicken juicier.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking rice in the flavored broth left from Phase 1. The beans and veg heat through while the rice cooks. Don't stir - layering prevents burning.

1.  **Check Liquid:** You should still have roughly **2 cups of flavored broth** in the pot. If it looks low, add a splash more broth or water. The rice needs liquid to cook.

2.  **Add Rice:** Pour **1.5 cups rinsed Basmati rice** (or Long Grain White) directly into the liquid. **Don't stir yet.**

3.  **Layer on Top (Don't Stir!):** 
   - Add **drained black beans** on top of the rice
   - Add **frozen pepper/onion mix** (handful) if using
   - **Optional:** Add a can or two of drained jalapeños or chilis for extra heat
   
   *Why layer, not stir?* Stirring can cause the rice to stick to the bottom and burn. Layering lets everything cook together without burning.

4.  **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **6 mins** if using **Basmati rice**
   - **5 mins** if using **Long Grain White rice**
   
   *Why different times?* Different rice types cook at different rates. Basmati is slightly longer grain, needs a bit more time.

5.  **Release:** After cooking, **wait 10 minutes** (Natural Release). **This is mandatory** - it's the "Starch Set Phase" that prevents mushy rice. Then manually vent remaining pressure.

6.  **Prep While Waiting:** While the rice finishes (during the 10m NR), **shred or slice your rested chicken**. Use two forks or just pull it apart with your hands.

### Phase 3: The Finish

**What You're Doing:** Combining everything and adding the "high notes" - fresh flavors that pressure cooking kills. This is where the dish comes alive.

1.  **Open & Fluff:** Carefully open the pot (steam will escape). Use a fork to **gently mix** the beans and veg into the rice. Don't mash - just fluff and combine.
   
   *Pro tip:* If the bottom is slightly toasted (socarrat), scrape it up and mix it in - it's delicious flavor gold!

2.  **Combine with Chicken:** Add your **shredded chicken** to the rice/bean mix. Mix gently with a fork.

3.  **The Final Drizzle:** Cut your **2nd lime in half** and **squeeze it over everything** in the pot. Give it a good squeeze - you want the juice, not just a few drops.
   
   *Why lime now?* Acid brightens the whole dish and cuts through the fat. It's the "wake up" flavor that makes everything pop.

4.  **High Notes:** Add **fresh cracked black pepper** (use a pepper grinder or crack whole peppercorns) and **fresh chopped cilantro** (if available). Sprinkle over the top.
   
   *Why these now?* Pressure cooking kills bright, fresh flavors. Adding pepper and cilantro at the end restores that brightness. Pepper adds heat and depth. Cilantro adds fresh, herbal notes that balance the richness.

5.  **Taste & Adjust:** Give it a taste. Need more salt? Add it now. Need more lime? Squeeze more. This is your chance to adjust.

## 📦 Meal Prep & Burrito Logic

### Storage
- Cool quickly, portion into containers
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Universal Reheating (The "OJ Hack")
1.  **Liquid:** Add a **splash of Orange Juice** (or water minimum) to the container. 
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar. 
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7** (prevents rubbery chicken).
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a pinch of **dried oregano** and **fresh cracked black pepper**. *Why:* Restores high notes lost during reheating. OJ adds brightness, oregano adds herbal depth.

**See `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method.**

### The Burrito Wrap Option
1.  **Warm:** Microwave tortilla for **20s** to make it pliable.
2.  **Fold:** Bottom up, sides in, roll tight. **Tuck as you roll.**
3.  **Quick Freeze:** Cool filling first. Place each in **individual zip lock bag** (label with date).
4.  **Freeze flat** on baking sheet (prevents sticking).
5.  **The Paper Towel Trick:** When reheating a frozen burrito, **remove from bag and wrap in a damp paper towel.** Microwave **2-3 mins** (flip halfway). The towel absorbs excess moisture so the tortilla stays soft, not soggy.

**Pro Tip:** Freeze individual burritos = grab-and-go meals. Paper towel method is key - prevents soggy tortilla.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Check that you started with 2 cups (not more).
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 14m is recommended, but 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Burn Error?** Don't panic! This can create **Socarrat** (toasted rice bottom) - scrape the bottom and mix it in. Soak the pot in hot soapy water for 20m post-meal.
*   **Chicken Shrinkage:** 4 thighs may look like a lot, but after the render, they perfectly balance 1.5 cups of rice.
*   **No trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.
*   **No individual spices?** Use 1 Taco/Fajita spice packet - works great!
*   **No lime?** Use lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (different but works).
*   **No cilantro?** Skip it - the recipe works fine without it. Or use parsley for a different herbal note.
*   **No fresh pepper?** Use ground black pepper (less bright, but works).
