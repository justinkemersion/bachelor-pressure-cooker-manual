# 03_Recipes: Chipotle Burrito Bowl - Fond Method (v1.1)
**Profile:** Tex-Mex | **Method:** Fond-Building Reduction | **Total Time:** 45m

**📚 Building on the Foundation** - This is an advanced variation of the Initiation Recipe. Master the standard method first (`chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`), then try this fond-building technique for maximum flavor depth.

**Note:** This is the "fond-building" alternative. More steps, but builds deep flavor through searing and reduction glaze.

## 🛒 Hardware & Variables
- [ ] **Protein:** **4 Chicken Thighs** (approx 1.75 lbs) — *Crucial for meal prep volume.*
- [ ] **Base:** 1.5 cups Basmati Rice (OR Long Grain White - see timing) (Rinsed until clear)
- [ ] **Liquid:** Water only (no broth needed - we build flavor later)
- [ ] **Bulk:** 1 can Black Beans (Drained)
- [ ] **Seasoning:** 1 Taco Packet (OR: 2tsp Cumin, 1tsp Chili, 1tsp Garlic, 1tsp Salt)
- [ ] **The Glaze:** 1/4 cup Water/Broth + 1 tbsp Worcestershire (optional) + 2 Fresh Limes
- [ ] **Heat:** 1 Habanero (Halved, seeds removed)
- [ ] **Bulk Fill:** Frozen pepper/onion mix (handful)

## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: Plain Protein Cook (10m NR)
1.  **If thawed:** Season chicken with spice mix (both sides). **If frozen:** Use pre-marinated frozen chicken.
2.  **Add 1 cup water** to pot (just for steam - no flavor needed here).
3.  **Optional Habanero:** If using habanero, add **halved, seeds removed** to water now (removes before Phase 2).
4.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
5.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **14 mins** (Frozen, **12m minimum**, up to 15m for larger pieces).
6.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.
7.  **Remove habanero** (if used) - discard. Heat has infused into liquid.
8.  **Remove chicken** to plate. **Save cooking liquid** - we'll use it for glaze.

### Phase 2: Plain Rice Cook (10m NR)
1.  **Add 1.5 cups water** to pot (plain water - no flavor yet).
2.  **Add rinsed rice** directly to water.
3.  **Add frozen peppers/onions:** Handful of bagged frozen mix (no chopping needed!).
4.  **Add beans** on top of rice (do not stir).
5.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure (Basmati) OR **5 mins** (Long Grain White).
6.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Do not skip—this sets the starch.**
7.  **Fluff rice** and remove to serving bowl/containers.
8.  **Clean pot completely** - remove all rice grains (important for next step).

### Phase 3: The Fond Build & Glaze
1.  **Set pot to Sauté (High).** Add **1-2 tbsp oil**, wait for "HOT".
2.  **Sear chicken** (both sides) **2-3 minutes per side** - build that fond!
3.  **Remove chicken** to cutting board. **Let rest 5 minutes.**
4.  **Deglaze:** Add **1/4 cup water/broth** (or saved cooking liquid) + **1 tbsp Worcestershire** (optional).
5.  **Add spices:** Stir in **1 Taco Packet** (OR: 2tsp Cumin, 1tsp Chili, 1tsp Garlic, 1tsp Salt) - this is where the flavor goes!
6.  **Scrape bottom** - get all those browned bits (the fond).
7.  **Reduce:** Let simmer **2-3 minutes** until slightly thickened (glaze consistency).
8.  **Remove from heat.** Add **juice of 1 lime** to glaze.

### Phase 4: The Finish
1.  **Slice/shred chicken** (should be rested).
2.  **Combine:** Rice + chicken + beans in bowl/containers.
3.  **The Glaze Drizzle:** Pour reduction glaze over everything.
4.  **Final Drizzle:** Squeeze **2nd lime** over bowl.
5.  **High Notes:** Add **cracked black pepper** and cilantro.

## 📦 Meal Prep & Burrito Logic

### Storage
- Cool quickly, portion into containers
- Refrigerate up to **3-4 days**

### Universal Reheating (The "OJ Hack")
1.  **Liquid:** Add a **splash of Orange Juice** (or water minimum) to the container. 
2.  **Steam:** Cover with lid slightly ajar. 
3.  **Power:** **3:30 mins** at **Power Level 7** (prevents rubbery chicken).
4.  **Finish:** Stir in a pinch of oregano and fresh pepper.

**See `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method.**

### The Burrito Wrap Option
1.  **Warm:** Microwave tortilla for **20s** to make it pliable.
2.  **Fold:** Bottom up, sides in, roll tight. **Tuck as you roll.**
3.  **Quick Freeze:** Cool filling first. Place each in **individual zip lock bag** (label with date).
4.  **Freeze flat** on baking sheet (prevents sticking).
5.  **The Paper Towel Trick:** When reheating a frozen burrito, **remove from bag and wrap in a damp paper towel.** Microwave **2-3 mins** (flip halfway). The towel absorbs excess moisture so the tortilla stays soft, not soggy.

**Pro Tip:** Freeze individual burritos = grab-and-go meals. Paper towel method is key - prevents soggy tortilla.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **Why Plain First?** We cook plain to preserve the chicken's natural juices, then build flavor through searing.
*   **The Fond:** Those browned bits = deep, complex flavor. The reduction glaze captures it all.
*   **Two-Stage Flavor:** Plain cook preserves texture, searing builds flavor - best of both worlds.
*   **The Glaze:** Reduction concentrates the fond flavor into a drizzle-able sauce.
*   **The Habanero Infusion:** Adding habanero in Phase 1 (if using) infuses "Ambient Heat" - it's everywhere, but not a "landmine." Seeds removed = controlled heat.
*   **More Steps, More Flavor:** This method takes longer but creates restaurant-quality depth.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much water. Use exactly 1.5 cups.
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 14m is recommended, but 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Fond burned?** Heat was too high. Medium-high is better for searing.
*   **Glaze too thin?** Reduce longer (3-4 minutes) until it coats the back of a spoon.
*   **Glaze too thick?** Add splash of water/broth to thin it.
*   **No Worcestershire?** Skip it - the fond alone makes great flavor.
*   **Chicken Shrinkage:** 4 thighs may look like a lot, but after the render, they perfectly balance 1.5 cups of rice.
*   **No trivet?** See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

## 📖 Quick Reference (Abbreviations)
- **HP** = High Pressure
- **NR** = Natural Release (let pressure drop naturally - wait 10 mins, then vent)
- **QR** = Quick Release (manually release pressure immediately)
- **10m NR** = Wait 10 minutes natural release, then quick release remaining
- **Sauté** = Sauté mode (browning/searing on stovetop setting)
