## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: Plain Protein Cook (10m NR)
1.  **If thawed:** Season chicken with spice mix (both sides). **If frozen:** Use pre-marinated frozen chicken.
2.  **Add 1 cup water** to pot (just for steam - no flavor needed here).
3.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
4.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **12-15 mins** (Frozen, 12m minimum).
5.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.
6.  **Remove chicken** to plate. **Save cooking liquid** - we'll use it for glaze.

### Phase 2: Plain Rice Cook (10m NR)
1.  **Add 1.5 cups water** to pot (plain water - no flavor yet).
2.  **Add rinsed rice** directly to water.
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **6 mins** High Pressure.
4.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Do not skip—this sets the starch.**
5.  **Fluff rice** and remove to serving bowl/containers.
6.  **Clean pot completely** - remove all rice grains (important for next step).

### Phase 3: The Fond Build & Glaze
1.  **Set pot to Sauté (High).** Add **1-2 tbsp oil**, wait for "HOT".
2.  **Sear chicken** (both sides) **2-3 minutes per side** - build that fond!
3.  **Remove chicken** to cutting board. **Let rest 5 minutes.**
4.  **Deglaze:** Add **1/4 cup water/broth** (or saved cooking liquid) + **1 tbsp Worcestershire** (optional).
5.  **Add spices:** Stir in **1 Taco Packet** (OR: 2tsp Cumin, 1tsp Chili, 1tsp Garlic, 1tsp Salt) - this is where the flavor goes!
6.  **Scrape bottom** - get all those browned bits (the fond).
7.  **Reduce:** Let simmer **2-3 minutes** until slightly thickened (glaze consistency).
8.  **Remove from heat.** Add **juice of 1 lime** to glaze.

### Phase 4: The Finish
1.  **Slice/shred chicken** (should be rested).
2.  **Combine:** Rice + chicken + beans in bowl/containers.
3.  **The Glaze Drizzle:** Pour reduction glaze over everything.
4.  **Final Drizzle:** Squeeze **2nd lime** over bowl.
5.  **High Notes:** Add **cracked black pepper** and cilantro.

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **Why Plain First?** We cook plain to preserve the chicken's natural juices, then build flavor through searing.
*   **The Fond:** Those browned bits = deep, complex flavor. The reduction glaze captures it all.
*   **Two-Stage Flavor:** Plain cook preserves texture, searing builds flavor - best of both worlds.
*   **The Glaze:** Reduction concentrates the fond flavor into a drizzle-able sauce.
*   **More Steps, More Flavor:** This method takes longer but creates restaurant-quality depth.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much water. Use exactly 1.5 cups.
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the 5-minute rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Fond burned?** Heat was too high. Medium-high is better for searing.
*   **Glaze too thin?** Reduce longer (3-4 minutes) until it coats the back of a spoon.
*   **Glaze too thick?** Add splash of water/broth to thin it.
*   **No Worcestershire?** Skip it - the fond alone makes great flavor.

## 📖 Quick Reference (Abbreviations)
- **HP** = High Pressure
- **NR** = Natural Release (let pressure drop naturally - wait 10 mins, then vent)
- **QR** = Quick Release (manually release pressure immediately)
- **10m NR** = Wait 10 minutes natural release, then quick release remaining
- **Sauté** = Sauté mode (browning/searing on stovetop setting)
