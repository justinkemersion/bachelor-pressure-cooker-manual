# Cheat Code Butter Chicken (v1.0)
**Mission:** Weeknight, Health Upgrade  
**Protein:** Chicken  
**Time Bucket:** Standard  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Heat:** Mild-Medium

**Profile:** Indian Curry | **Method:** Pot-in-Pot (PIP) | **Total Time:** ~40m

**🧱 New Lego Block: Pot-in-Pot (PIP) = Thick Sauce + Perfect Rice (Zero Burn)**

## 🎓 THE "CHEAT CODE" CONCEPT
Traditional Butter Chicken (*Murgh Makhani*) often means **overnight marinade**, **tandoor/roast**, and a finish with **heavy whipping cream**. It’s amazing—but it’s a project, and it’s calorie-dense.

This recipe is the **weeknight version**:
- **The Yogurt Hack:** Greek yogurt + a small **butter mount** at the end = “creaminess” with **way more protein** and **less fat**.
- **The PIP Hack:** Pot-in-Pot lets you cook **rice + curry** in one pressure cycle without burn drama from thick tomato sauce.

**📚 Building on the Foundation**: Reference the **Initiation Recipe** (`chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`) for safety checks + release basics. For the universal PIP setup, see `02_techniques/core_techniques.md#pot-in-pot`.

## 📋 Quick Reference
- **End State:** Thick, glossy orange sauce that coats chicken; rice fully tender and separate.
- **Rice (PIP):** 1 cup rinsed rice → **1 cup water** (strict 1:1 for PIP bowl)
- **Cook:** **6 mins HP** + **10m NR**
- **Yogurt:** cool sauce **2–3 mins** before stirring in (prevents curdling)
- **Spice lock-in (recommended):** serrano + flakes for baseline heat, then adjust at the end
- **Scaling:** Double chicken → keep liquid the same; increase spices by ~**1.5×**, not 2×

## Ingredients

### The Protein + Sauce Base
- [ ] **1.5–2 lbs Chicken Thighs** (boneless/skinless), cut bite-size
- [ ] **1 onion**, diced
- [ ] **1 tbsp ginger/garlic paste** (or fresh minced)
- [ ] **1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce** (or crushed tomatoes)
- [ ] **1/2 cup water or chicken broth** (helps pressure + reduces burn risk; reduce later if needed)
- [ ] **Salt** (start with **1 tsp** — tomato brands vary; finish to taste after yogurt)

### The “Cheat Code” Spices
- [ ] **1 tbsp garam masala** (**NEW**)
- [ ] **1 tsp turmeric**
- [ ] **1 tsp cumin**
- [ ] **1 tsp chili powder** (or cayenne for more heat)

### Heat Options (Pick Your Level)
- [ ] **1 serrano pepper**, minced (keep seeds for hotter; remove for medium)
- [ ] **1/2–1 habanero**, whole/halved — *infuses heat while cooking; remove before yogurt step*
- [ ] **1/2 tsp red pepper flakes** (bloom with spices for reliable heat)
- [ ] **Cayenne** (finisher): start with **1/8 tsp**, taste, repeat

### The Finish (Healthy “Butter Chicken” Feel)
- [ ] **1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt** (2% or full-fat)
- [ ] **1 tbsp butter**

### Rice (Pot-in-Pot Bowl)
- [ ] **1 cup basmati rice**, rinsed
- [ ] **1 cup water**
- [ ] **Pinch of salt**

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Bloom + Deglaze (Burn-Proof Setup)
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**. Add a little oil (or use part of the butter).
2. Add **onion**. Sauté **~3 mins** until soft.
3. **Optional heat (recommended):** Add minced **serrano** and cook **30–60 seconds**.
4. Add **ginger/garlic** + **garam masala, turmeric, cumin, chili powder** (and **red pepper flakes** if using). Stir **30 seconds** (don’t burn).
5. **Deglaze:** splash in water/broth and **scrape the bottom** until clean.

### Phase 2: Build the Sauce (Don’t Smear the Bottom)
1. Turn off Sauté.
2. Add chicken + tomato sauce + **1/2 cup water/broth**. Stir just enough to coat.
3. **Tip:** Thick tomato sauce can burn if it gets mashed into the bottom. Avoid aggressive stirring here.
4. **Optional serious heat:** Add **1/2–1 habanero** (whole or halved). You’ll remove it before the yogurt step.

### Phase 3: Pot-in-Pot (Rice Above, Sauce Below)
1. Place the **tall trivet** in the pot.
2. In an oven-safe bowl, combine **1 cup rinsed rice + 1 cup water + pinch of salt**.
3. Place bowl on the trivet. Lock lid.
4. **Pressure Cook:** **6 minutes HP**, then **10 minutes NR**.
5. Remove rice bowl + trivet. Fluff rice.

### Phase 4: Make it “Butter Chicken”
1. If sauce is thin, use **Sauté** for **2–4 mins** to reduce.
2. If you used habanero, **remove it now**.
3. Turn heat **OFF**. Let sauce cool **2–3 mins**.
4. **Yogurt rule:** Sauce should stop bubbling entirely before yogurt goes in.
5. Stir in **Greek yogurt** + **1 tbsp butter** (whisk hard to emulsify).
6. Taste and adjust **salt**. If too sharp, add a **pinch of sugar/honey**.
7. **Finisher heat:** Add a pinch of **red pepper flakes** and/or **1/8 tsp cayenne**, taste, repeat.

## Storage & Reheating
**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

**Notes:**
- Store rice and chicken/sauce separately if you can (best texture).
- Reheat sauce gently; boiling can make yogurt-based sauces look grainy.

---

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes
- **Why PIP works:** thick sauces are the #1 burn trigger. Separating rice prevents starch + sauce from settling on the bottom.
- **Why yogurt works:** you get “creaminess” from protein structure/emulsion, not heavy cream.
- **Why you cool first:** yogurt curdles when the sauce is boiling.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
- **Burn notice?** You didn’t deglaze/scrape clean, or the sauce was too thick/dry. Add a splash of water/broth next time and don’t smear thick sauce on the bottom.
- **Curdled/grainy sauce?** Sauce was boiling when yogurt went in. Fix: whisk hard; worst case blend briefly.
- **Rice undercooked?** Use a metal bowl for best heat transfer; thick glass/ceramic may need +2 mins.
