**Mission:** Weeknight, Meal Prep  
**Protein:** Chicken  
**Time Bucket:** Standard  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Heat:** Medium

**Profile:** Tex-Mex | **Method:** Sequential One-Pot + Shredding + Salsa Verde Finish | **Total Time:** 40m

**🧱 New Lego Block: Shredding Technique + Salsa Verde Integration**

**📚 Building on the Foundation** - Reference the **Initiation Recipe** (`chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`) for fundamentals (liquid ratios, safety checks, troubleshooting). This recipe focuses on what’s new: **reliable shredding** and using **jarred salsa verde** as a **bright finishing sauce** (no chopping).

**What You’re Learning Here:**
- **Shredding technique:** fast ways to pull chicken without making a mess
- **Jarred ingredient integration:** salsa verde as “instant complexity”
- **Acid timing:** salsa verde goes in **after** pressure cooking (keeps rice texture clean)
- **How to reuse the block:** tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas, meal prep

**Use This Technique In:** Any chicken bowl where you want pulled texture and a bright sauce finish.

**📦 Pantry Impact:** MEDIUM - **Jarred salsa verde** is the only “buy for this recipe” item. It’s cheap, but more single-use than most pantry staples.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: The Bird (8m HP + 10m NR)
**What You’re Doing:** Cooking chicken in Tex-Mex spices. We keep the liquid clean so rice cooks perfectly in Phase 2.

1. **Add Liquid & Seasonings:** Pour **2 cups broth** into the pot. Add **cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt**. Stir once.
2. **Insert Trivet (Optional):** If you have a trivet, use it. If not, put chicken directly into the liquid (thighs are forgiving).
3. **Add Chicken:** Add thighs.
4. **Pressure Cook:** High Pressure:
   - **8 mins** (thawed)
   - **14 mins** (frozen, 12m minimum; up to 15m if large)
5. **Natural Release:** Wait **10 mins** (NR), then vent remaining pressure.

### Phase 2: The Base (Rice) (5-6m HP + 10m NR)
1. **Move Chicken Out:** Put chicken on a plate (cover loosely).
2. **Check Liquid:** You should still have roughly **2 cups of flavored liquid** in the pot. If it looks low, add a splash of water/broth.
3. **Add Rice:** Add **1.5 cups rinsed rice** to the pot.
4. **Optional Bulk:** Add beans/corn/veg on top (don’t worry about perfection).
5. **Pressure Cook Rice:**
   - **6 mins** (Basmati)
   - **5 mins** (Long Grain White)
6. **Natural Release:** Wait **10 mins** (NR), then vent.
7. **Fluff:** Fluff rice with a fork.

### Phase 3: Shred + Salsa Verde (3-5 minutes)
**What You’re Doing:** Turning chicken into pulled texture and finishing with a bright sauce.

1. **Shred the Chicken (Choose a method):**
   - **Two forks:** hold with one fork, pull with the other
   - **Hands:** once cool enough, pull apart (fastest)
   - **In the pot (lazy method):** return chicken to the empty pot and mash/pull with tongs or a fork
2. **Add Salsa Verde:** Toss shredded chicken with **1/2 cup salsa verde** first. Add more until it’s the level of saucy you want.
3. **Warm (Optional):** If you want it hotter/thicker, press **Sauté** for **1-2 minutes**, stirring.

### Phase 4: Finish & Serve (2 minutes)
1. **Build Bowls:** Rice base + shredded salsa-verde chicken on top.
2. **High Notes:** Add **fresh cracked pepper** and a quick hit of **lime** if you have it.
3. **Optional:** This is amazing as tacos/burritos/quesadillas the next day.

## Storage & Reheating

**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

### Recipe-Specific Notes
- **Store chicken + salsa separately (best):** keeps rice from getting wet.
- **Reheat tip:** After microwaving, add **1-2 tbsp salsa verde** to bring back brightness.

---

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works
- **Shredding = texture upgrade:** Pulled chicken spreads sauce evenly and feels “taco shop” instead of chunks.
- **Salsa verde as finishing sauce:** bright, acidic, herby flavors that pressure cooking can’t preserve.
- **Acid timing:** adding salsa verde **after** rice cooks prevents weird rice texture (acid can toughen grains).

### Substitutions
**Recipe Independence Note:** This recipe can be made independently—no other recipes required.

- **No salsa verde?** → Use **green enchilada sauce** OR **hot sauce + lime** OR **canned green chilis + lime** (different, still good).
- **No cumin/chili powder?** → Use a **taco seasoning packet**.
- **Want more heat?** → Add **pickled jalapeños** or extra adobo/hot sauce after cooking.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**For universal troubleshooting (rice, chicken, pressure cooker issues):** See `04_reference/universal_troubleshooting.md`

### Recipe-Specific Issues
- **Chicken not shredding easily?** It’s undercooked. Put it back in for **2-4 mins HP + 10m NR**.
- **Too sour/too sharp?** Cut it with sour cream/yogurt, or add a pinch of sugar.
- **Too watery chicken?** Sauté 1-3 minutes to reduce before serving.
