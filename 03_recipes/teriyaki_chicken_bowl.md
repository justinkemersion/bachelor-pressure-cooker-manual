# Teriyaki Chicken Bowl (v1.0)
**Profile:** Japanese-American | **Method:** Sequential One-Pot + Teriyaki Glaze Reduction | **Total Time:** 40m

**🧱 New Lego Block: Teriyaki Glaze + Rice Wine Applications**

**📚 Building on the Foundation** - Reference the **Initiation Recipe** (`chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`) for fundamentals (liquid ratios, safety checks, troubleshooting). This recipe focuses on what's new: **Creating a sticky teriyaki glaze** and **rice wine/mirin applications** (or substitutions).

**What You're Learning Here:**
- **Teriyaki Glaze Technique:** Creating the classic sticky, sweet teriyaki glaze from cooking liquid
- **Rice Wine/Mirin:** Using rice wine for depth (or substitutions if you don't have it)
- **Asian Flavor Profile:** Japanese-American teriyaki (sweet, savory, umami-rich)
- **Glaze Reduction:** Similar to honey garlic, but with teriyaki's signature flavor profile

**Use This Technique In:** Any recipe where you want teriyaki-style sticky glaze (teriyaki bowls, Asian-inspired dishes, etc.)

**💡 Universal Tip:** Any bowl can become a burrito or taco! Warm a tortilla (20s in microwave), add your bowl contents, wrap it up. Works for ALL recipes in this cookbook.

**📦 Pantry Impact:** MEDIUM - **Rice vinegar** is new (versatile for Asian cooking, $3-5, lasts 1+ year). **Honey** can be substituted with brown sugar (see below). **Mirin** can be substituted (see below). **Soy sauce** is already in your pantry (Tier 2). **Ginger powder** is optional (Tier 3) - recipe works without it.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: The Bird (8m HP + 10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking the chicken in teriyaki-style liquid (honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger). The chicken sits on a trivet so it steams, not boils. The cooking liquid becomes our teriyaki glaze base.

1. **Add Liquid & Seasonings:** Pour **2 cups broth** into the pot. Add **2 tbsp honey** (OR 2 tbsp brown sugar), **2 tbsp soy sauce**, **1 tbsp rice vinegar**, **1 tsp ginger powder**, **1 tsp garlic powder**, and **1 tsp salt**. **Optional upgrades:** Add 1 tbsp mirin (OR 1 tbsp white wine + 1/2 tsp sugar) and/or 1/2 tsp sesame seeds. **Stir once** to mix - the honey will dissolve as it heats.

   *Why now?* The honey, soy sauce, and rice vinegar infuse the chicken as it cooks. The liquid becomes our teriyaki glaze base - it's already flavored!

2. **Insert Trivet:** Place the metal trivet (rack) in the pot. The chicken sits on top, not submerged. *No trivet?* See `01_fundamentals/bachelor_hacks.md` for foil trivet trick.

3. **Add Chicken:** Place **4 chicken thighs** on the trivet, skin-side up if they have skin. **Don't submerge them** - they should sit above the liquid.

4. **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **8 minutes** (thawed chicken)
   - **14 minutes** (frozen chicken, 12m minimum)
   
   The cooker will take 5-8 minutes to come to pressure.

5. **Natural Release:** Once cooking is done, **wait 10 minutes** (this is the Natural Release - NR). The timer will count down. **Don't touch anything** - let the pressure drop naturally. This is crucial for chicken texture.

6. **Quick Release:** After 10 minutes, turn the valve to **Venting** (Quick Release - QR) to release any remaining pressure. Wait until the float valve drops.

7. **Remove Chicken:** Use tongs to carefully remove the chicken thighs. Place them on a plate or cutting board. **Save the cooking liquid** - this is our teriyaki glaze base! Don't discard it.

8. **Rest the Chicken:** Let the chicken rest **5 minutes minimum**. This makes it juicy. Cover loosely with foil if you want.

### Phase 2: The Rice (6m HP + 10m NR)

**What You're Doing:** Cooking rice in the same pot, using the same flavored liquid (plus a bit more if needed).

1. **Check Liquid:** You should still have roughly **2 cups of flavored liquid** in the pot. If it looks low, add a splash more broth or water. The rice needs liquid to cook.

2. **Add Rice:** Add **1.5 cups rinsed rice** to the pot. Stir once to mix rice with liquid.

3. **Add Beans (Optional):** If using black beans, add them now. Stir gently.

4. **Pressure Cook:** Lock the lid. Set to **High Pressure** for:
   - **6 minutes** (Basmati)
   - **5 minutes** (Long Grain White)
   
   The cooker will take 5-8 minutes to come to pressure.

5. **Natural Release:** Once cooking is done, **wait 10 minutes** (NR). This is mandatory for rice to finish cooking and set properly.

6. **Quick Release:** After 10 minutes, turn the valve to **Venting** (QR) to release any remaining pressure.

7. **Fluff the Rice:** Use a fork to fluff the rice gently (don't mash it - just separate the grains).

### Phase 3: The Teriyaki Glaze (5 minutes)

**What You're Doing:** Reducing the cooking liquid from Phase 1 to create a thick, sticky teriyaki glaze. This is the "restaurant-quality" finish. **We're using the pressure cooker's sauté function - no extra pans needed!**

1. **Strain the Liquid:** After removing the rice (Phase 2), pour the remaining cooking liquid from the pot through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. This removes any chicken bits. You should have about **1/2-3/4 cup** of liquid.

2. **Pour Back into Cooker:** Pour the strained liquid back into the pressure cooker pot.

3. **Reduce the Liquid:** Press **Sauté** button (or **Sauté** → **Medium** if your cooker has heat settings). The liquid will start to bubble and reduce. Stir occasionally with a wooden spatula.

4. **Watch for Thickness:** The liquid will start to thicken as water evaporates. You'll see it:
   - Start thin and watery
   - Get slightly thicker (like thin syrup)
   - Get noticeably thicker (like honey)
   - **Stop when it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon** (about 3-5 minutes)

5. **Test the Glaze:** Dip a spoon into the liquid. If it coats the spoon and doesn't run off immediately, it's ready. It should be **thick and sticky**, like honey or maple syrup - this is the classic teriyaki texture.

6. **Cancel Sauté:** Press **Cancel** to turn off the sauté function. The glaze will continue to thicken as it cools.

### Phase 4: Finish & Serve (2 minutes)

1. **Portion the Rice:** Divide the rice (and beans, if using) into bowls.

2. **Add the Chicken:** Place chicken thighs on top of the rice.

3. **Drizzle the Glaze:** Drizzle the **reduced teriyaki glaze** over the chicken and rice. Start with 1-2 tbsp per bowl - you can always add more. The glaze should be thick and sticky.

4. **Optional Finishing Touch:** Drizzle **1 tsp sesame oil** over the top (if you have it). This adds authentic Asian flavor and richness.

5. **Add Fresh Pepper:** Crack fresh black pepper over the top. This adds brightness that pressure cooking kills.

6. **Serve Immediately:** This is best eaten fresh and hot, while the glaze is still warm and sticky.

## Storage & Reheating

**For universal storage and reheating guidelines:** See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md`

### Recipe-Specific Notes

**Teriyaki Glaze Storage:**
- **Store glaze separately:** The glaze will thicken in the fridge. Store in a small container (lasts 1-2 weeks).
- **Reheating with glaze:** After reheating the bowl, drizzle a bit of the stored glaze over the top (it will warm up and become sticky again).
- **If glaze is too thick:** Warm the glaze separately (microwave 10-15 seconds) OR add a tiny bit of water to thin it, then drizzle.

## Chemistry Notes

### Why This Works

**The Teriyaki Flavor Profile:**
- **Honey/Brown Sugar (sweet):** Creates the signature teriyaki sweetness
- **Soy Sauce (savory/umami):** Adds depth and saltiness - the foundation of teriyaki
- **Rice Vinegar (bright acid):** Adds Asian brightness without overpowering (milder than other vinegars)
- **Ginger Powder (warmth):** Adds Asian warmth and depth
- **Together:** They create the classic teriyaki flavor - sweet, savory, umami-rich, with Asian warmth

**The Teriyaki Glaze Reduction:**
- **Water evaporates:** As you simmer the liquid, water evaporates, concentrating the flavors
- **Honey thickens:** Honey naturally thickens when heated and reduced (creates sticky texture)
- **Soy sauce concentrates:** The umami flavors in soy sauce become more intense as water evaporates
- **Rice vinegar balances:** The mild acid balances the sweetness, preventing the glaze from being cloying
- **Result:** A thick, sticky, sweet-savory glaze that clings to the chicken and rice - classic teriyaki!

**Why Cook Chicken First:**
- **Flavor infusion:** The chicken absorbs the teriyaki flavors as it cooks
- **Cooking liquid becomes glaze base:** The liquid that the chicken cooked in is already flavored - perfect for reducing into a teriyaki glaze
- **Sequential cooking:** Rice cooks in the same pot, picking up residual teriyaki flavors

**Why 2 Cups Liquid:**
- **The "Burn-Proof" 1:1 + Buffer:** For sequential cooking (protein then rice), start with 2 cups
- **Tested and proven:** The initiation recipe uses 2 cups liquid for 1.5 cups rice - this ratio works perfectly
- **Rice needs 1.5 cups:** The rice will absorb what it needs (1:1 ratio), and you'll have extra liquid for the glaze
- **Glaze base:** The remaining liquid (after rice absorbs what it needs) becomes your teriyaki glaze

### Substitutions

**Recipe Independence Note:** This recipe can be made without having made previous recipes. All ingredients have substitution options.

- **No honey?** → Use **brown sugar** (2 tbsp) - dissolves in liquid, creates similar sweetness. *Honey is introduced in the Honey Garlic recipe, but you don't need it for this recipe - brown sugar works perfectly.*
- **No rice vinegar?** → Use **apple cider vinegar** (1 tbsp) - different flavor but adds brightness. *Rice vinegar is NEW to this recipe - if you don't want to buy it, apple cider vinegar works.*
- **No mirin?** → **Option 1:** Use **1 tbsp white wine + 1/2 tsp sugar** - approximates mirin's sweetness and depth. **Option 2:** Skip it - recipe works fine without it (just slightly less depth)
- **No ginger powder?** → Skip it - recipe works fine without it, but ginger adds authentic Asian warmth. *Ginger powder is optional (Tier 3) - not required.*
- **No sesame oil?** → Skip it - the glaze is delicious without it, but sesame oil adds authentic finishing flavor
- **Want more heat?** → Add **1/4 tsp red pepper flakes** to Phase 1, or drizzle **sriracha** over finished bowl
- **Different protein?** → Adjust timing per `01_fundamentals/timing_charts.md` (thighs = 8m, breast = 6-8m, etc.)

### Scaling the Glaze

**If you have too much glaze:**
- Store it in the fridge (lasts 1-2 weeks)
- Use it on other proteins (chicken, pork, fish, salmon)
- Drizzle over rice bowls, stir-fries, vegetables
- Great for meal prep - make a batch and use throughout the week

**If you have too little glaze:**
- The reduction process concentrates the liquid - you'll always have less volume than you started with
- This is normal! A little glaze goes a long way
- If you need more, make a quick batch: 1 tbsp honey + 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tsp rice vinegar + 1/4 cup water, reduce until thick

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**For universal troubleshooting (rice, chicken, pressure cooker issues):** See `04_reference/universal_troubleshooting.md`

### Recipe-Specific Issues (Teriyaki Glaze)

*   **Glaze is too thin?** Keep reducing! Simmer longer until it thickens. It should coat the back of a spoon.
*   **Glaze is too thick?** Add a tiny bit of water (1 tsp at a time) and stir until desired consistency.
*   **Glaze burned?** You had the heat too high. Next time, use medium heat and stir more often. Start over with fresh liquid if needed.
*   **Not enough glaze?** This is normal - reduction concentrates flavors. A little goes a long way. If you need more, see "Scaling the Glaze" above.
*   **Glaze too sweet?** Add a tiny splash of rice vinegar (1 tsp) to balance the sweetness.
*   **Glaze not sweet enough?** Add a tiny bit more honey (1 tsp) or brown sugar to the reduction.
