## 🛠 Execution (The Script)

### Phase 1: The Bird (10m NR)
1.  **Dump** broth, Worcestershire, and seasonings into the pot. Stir once.
2.  **Insert Trivet.** Place chicken on top (don't submerge).
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **8 mins** (Thawed) OR **12-15 mins** (Frozen, **12m minimum**).
4.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release), then vent.
5.  **Acid Rest:** Move chicken to a plate. **Drizzle 1-2 tbsp balsamic** over it immediately. Cover with foil.

### Phase 2: The Base (10m NR)
1.  **Add Rice** directly into the flavored liquid remaining in the pot.
2.  **Add Beans** on top of the rice. **Do not stir.**
3.  **Pressure Cook:** **4 mins** High Pressure.
4.  **Release:** Wait 10 mins (Natural Release). **Do not skip—this sets the starch.**
5.  **Prep:** While rice cooks, shred/slice your resting chicken.

### Phase 3: The Finish
1.  **Open & Fluff:** Use a fork to mix the beans and rice.
2.  **The Final Drizzle:** Drizzle remaining **1-2 tbsp balsamic** over everything. 
3.  **The Fat Balance:** Drizzle **1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil** (optional but recommended - smooths the balsamic bite).
4.  **High Notes:** Add a heavy hit of **cracked black pepper** and fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, or basil if available).

## 🧪 Chemistry Notes (Bachelor Logic)
*   **The 1:1 + Splash:** We start with 1.75 cups of liquid because the rice needs 1.5. The extra 0.25 accounts for the tiny bit of steam lost during the first release.
*   **The Resting Balsamic:** Drizzling balsamic on the chicken *while it rests* allows the acid to penetrate the meat fibers, cutting through the fat and adding depth.
*   **The Fat Balance:** Balsamic is high-acid and can taste "sharp" alone. The **Extra Virgin Olive Oil** balances the acid, making the dish feel "expensive" and smoothing out the vinegar bite.
*   **Worcestershire in Liquid:** Adds umami depth during cooking - the rice absorbs this savory flavor.
*   **Jasmine Timing:** 4 mins HP (faster than Basmati) - delicate grain, perfect for Mediterranean dishes.
*   **Grain/Legume Sync:** Cannellini beans are softer than black beans. With 4-minute Jasmine rice, they won't over-soften. **If you were doing a 20-minute Brown Rice cook, these beans would turn to mush.** This is perfect timing sync.
*   **Sequential Logic:** We cook chicken first so it has time to rest (making it juicier) while the rice cooks.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **Rice is crunchy?** Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
*   **Rice is mushy?** You used too much liquid. Use exactly 1.75 cups next time.
*   **Chicken is dry?** You skipped the rest. Never skip the rest.
*   **Frozen chicken not done?** 12m is minimum - larger pieces may need 15m. The 10m NR continues cooking.
*   **Too sweet?** Balsamic can be sweet - add a splash of red wine vinegar to balance.
*   **No Worcestershire?** Use 1 tbsp soy sauce + pinch of sugar (adds umami).
