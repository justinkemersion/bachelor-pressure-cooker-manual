# Heat Spectrum Theory (The “Full Spectrum” Concept)
**Status:** 🔒 Locked (Open after mastering the Chipotle Bowl)  
**Goal:** Maximum flavor, controlled burn (heat that tastes *good*, not just pain)

**Use this when:** You want “spicy” to have **depth** (slow warmth) + **brightness** (fresh crack), not just one-note fire.

## 🎧 The Audio Equalizer Metaphor
Think of heat like a stereo system. To get “rich” sound you need **Bass + Mids + Treble**. If you only have Treble, it hurts. If you only have Bass, it’s muddy.

### 1) The Bass (Ambient Heat)
- **The Pepper:** Habanero, Scotch Bonnet (hotter options exist; this is the useful baseline)
- **The Feeling:** Deep, chest-warming, slow-building glow
- **The Flavor:** Fruity/floral/tropical
- **The Technique:** **INFUSION**
  - **How:** Halved (seeds removed), pressure cooked in the liquid/sauce, then discarded
  - **Result:** You get the “bass” warmth + flavor without the sharp sting

### 2) The Treble (Sharp Heat)
- **The Pepper:** Serrano, Thai chili, fresh jalapeño
- **The Feeling:** Sharp, instant sting + “bright” pop
- **The Flavor:** Grassy/green/crisp
- **The Technique:** **GARNISH**
  - **How:** Slice paper-thin, add raw after cooking
  - **Result:** You get crunch + the fresh green spike that cuts through rich food

### 3) The Mids (Body Heat / Blend Heat)
- **The Pepper/Tool:** Red pepper flakes, chili powder, cayenne
- **The Feeling:** Steady “through the middle” heat
- **The Flavor:** Depends (flakes add texture, chili powder adds flavor, cayenne is mostly heat)
- **The Technique:** **BLOOM**
  - **How:** Add to hot oil with spices for ~30 seconds (don’t burn)
  - **Result:** Reliable heat that survives pressure cooking

## 🧪 The “Bachelor Lab” Experiment (Low Risk)
*Don’t risk a whole dinner on this yet. Run the experiment on one serving.*

**The Double-Layer Protocol:**
1. Cook your standard Chipotle Bowl with the **Habanero Infusion** (Phase 1). This gives you the “Bass.”
2. Prep **one serrano**: slice super thin.
3. When serving, add **3 slices** raw serrano on top.
4. Eat and notice: deep warmth first (bass), then fresh crack and zing (treble).

**Why it works:** Fat (chicken/broth) softens the bass heat; raw serrano cuts through the fat with fresh green brightness.

## ⚠️ Safety / Control Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Wear gloves (or bag-glove hack) for habanero and hotter.
- Infusion peppers go in **whole/halved** so you can remove them.
- If you overdo it: add more yogurt/dairy, a pinch of sugar/honey, and more rice.
