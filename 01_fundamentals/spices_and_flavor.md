# The Bachelor's Flavor Chemistry Guide

## Core Spice Categories

### Universal Base Spices
These work in almost any savory dish:

- **Garlic Powder** - Umami base, use 1-2 tsp per pound of protein
- **Onion Powder** - Sweetness and depth, pairs with garlic
- **Oregano** - Mediterranean base, works in Italian, Mexican, Greek
- **Paprika** - Color and mild heat, use for visual appeal
- **Black Pepper** - Add post-cook for brightness (grounds during pressure cooking)
- **Salt** - Always layer: some during cooking, some at finish

### Heat Spices (Dried)
- **Cayenne** - Pure heat, use sparingly (1/4-1/2 tsp)
- **Chili Powder** - Heat + flavor (cumin, garlic, oregano blend)
- **Red Pepper Flakes** - Texture + heat, add post-cook

### Fresh Peppers: The Heat Element
Fresh peppers add **identifiable heat** and **flavor complexity** that dried spices can't match. They're the difference between "spicy" and "that habanero heat I recognize."

#### Heat Levels (Practical Guide)

| Pepper | Heat Level | Flavor Profile | Best For | Bachelor Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jalapeño** | Mild-Medium | Fresh, grassy | Tex-Mex, salsas | Remove seeds = milder |
| **Serrano** | Medium | Sharp, bright | Mexican, Thai | Slightly hotter than jalapeño |
| **Habanero** | Very Hot | Fruity, tropical | Caribbean, Tex-Mex | **Distinct flavor** - you'll know it |
| **Poblano** | Mild | Earthy, rich | Mexican, roasted dishes | Very mild, mostly flavor |

**Heat Scale (Practical):**
- **Mild (Poblano):** Adds flavor, minimal heat
- **Medium (Jalapeño, Serrano):** Noticeable heat, manageable
- **Hot (Habanero):** **Respect the heat** - use sparingly, always remove seeds

#### 🚨 Safety First: Handling Hot Peppers

**The Golden Rule:** **Always wear gloves** when handling habaneros or any hot pepper. The oils can burn your skin and **will burn your eyes** if you touch them.

**What to Do:**
1. **Wear disposable gloves** - OR use the **Bachelor Hack: Ziplock Bag Glove**
   - **No gloves?** Grab a ziplock bag (sandwich or quart size)
   - **Put your hand inside** like a glove
   - **Hold the pepper** through the bag
   - **Slice and remove seeds** - the bag protects your hands
   - **Toss the bag** when done (or wash and reuse if you're thrifty)
   - **Pro tip:** Use the bag to hold the pepper while you scrape out seeds with a spoon
2. **Wash hands thoroughly** after handling (even with gloves/bag)
3. **Don't touch your face** until hands are clean
4. **Remove seeds and membranes** - this is where most heat lives

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Touch peppers bare-handed then rub your eyes
- ❌ Skip gloves with habaneros (you'll regret it)
- ❌ Use the same cutting board for peppers and other food without washing

#### How to Prepare Peppers

**For Infusion (Phase 1 - Adds Heat Throughout):**
1. **Slice in half lengthwise**
2. **Remove seeds and white membranes** (scrape with a spoon)
3. **Add to cooking liquid** during Phase 1
4. **Remove before Phase 2** (heat has infused into liquid)

**For Fresh Heat (Phase 3 - Bright, Sharp Heat):**
1. **Dice finely** (seeds removed)
2. **Add after cooking** as garnish/topping
3. **Stir in at the end** for immediate heat

**The Bachelor's Method (Habanero Infusion):**
- Slice 1 habanero in half
- Remove seeds (use gloves!)
- Place both halves in Phase 1 cooking liquid
- Remove before Phase 2
- **Result:** Beautiful, identifiable habanero heat throughout the dish without overwhelming spice

#### When to Use Fresh Peppers

**Phase 1 (Infusion Method):**
- ✅ Want heat **throughout the dish**
- ✅ Want **subtle, ambient heat** (not sharp)
- ✅ Cooking liquid will absorb the heat
- ✅ **Best for:** Habanero, serrano (hot peppers)

**Phase 3 (Fresh Method):**
- ✅ Want **bright, sharp heat**
- ✅ Want heat that **hits immediately**
- ✅ Want to **control heat per serving**
- ✅ **Best for:** Jalapeño, serrano (medium peppers)

**Both Methods:**
- ✅ Want **maximum heat and flavor**
- ✅ Add in Phase 1 for infusion, add fresh in Phase 3 for brightness

#### Substitution Guide

**No fresh peppers?**
- **Habanero heat:** 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne (lacks the fruity flavor)
- **Jalapeño heat:** 1-2 tsp red pepper flakes (lacks freshness)
- **Canned chilis:** Green chilis, jalapeños in cans work great (see `bachelor_hacks.md`)

**Too hot?**
- Remove seeds and membranes (90% of heat lives here)
- Use less pepper (half instead of whole)
- Add dairy (sour cream, cheese) to cool down

**Not hot enough?**
- Add more peppers (but start small!)
- Keep seeds in (careful - this is a big jump)
- Add fresh diced pepper in Phase 3 for immediate heat

### Earthy/Warm Spices
- **Cumin** - Survives pressure cooking, essential for Tex-Mex/Middle Eastern
- **Coriander** - Citrusy, pairs with cumin
- **Chili Powder** - Blend of cumin, paprika, garlic, oregano

### Fresh vs. Dried
- **Dried herbs** (oregano, thyme, rosemary) - Add before pressure cooking
- **Fresh herbs** (cilantro, parsley, basil) - Add post-cook as garnish/drizzle

## Acids: The Brightness Factor

### When to Use Acids
- **After cooking** - Acids brighten and cut through fat
- **Heavy/fatty dishes** - Always pair with acid
- **Bland dishes** - Acid wakes up flavors

### Common Acids

| Acid | Flavor Profile | Best For | When to Add |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lemon Juice** | Bright, citrusy | Mediterranean, chicken, fish | Post-cook |
| **Lime Juice** | Sharp, tropical | Mexican, Thai, Tex-Mex | Post-cook |
| **Apple Cider Vinegar** | Mild, slightly sweet | Versatile, chicken, vegetables | Post-cook |
| **Red Wine Vinegar** | Bold, tangy | Italian, Mediterranean | Post-cook |
| **Balsamic Vinegar** | Sweet, complex | Italian, roasted vegetables | Post-cook |
| **White Wine Vinegar** | Clean, sharp | Delicate dishes | Post-cook |

### Acid Substitution Guide
- **No lemon?** → Apple cider vinegar + pinch of sugar
- **No lime?** → Lemon juice (slightly different but works)
- **No balsamic?** → Red wine vinegar + pinch of sugar
- **No vinegar?** → Lemon/lime juice (more acidic, use less)

## Umami: The Depth Factor

### What is Umami?
The "savory" taste that adds depth and richness. Think: meaty, brothy, satisfying.

### Umami Sources

| Source | Flavor | Best For | When to Add |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Worcestershire Sauce** | Complex, savory | Beef, chicken, marinades | During cooking |
| **Soy Sauce** | Salty, savory | Asian, marinades, rice | During cooking |
| **Fish Sauce** | Funky, deep | Thai, Vietnamese | During cooking (sparingly) |
| **Tomato Paste** | Sweet, savory | Italian, stews, rice dishes | Before pressure (sear it) |
| **Mushroom Powder** | Earthy, deep | Vegetarian dishes, rice | During cooking |
| **MSG** | Pure umami | Any savory dish | During cooking (tiny amounts) |

### Umami Substitution Guide
- **No Worcestershire?** → Soy sauce + pinch of sugar + dash of vinegar
- **No soy sauce?** → Worcestershire (different flavor but adds umami)
- **No fish sauce?** → Soy sauce (lacks funk but adds depth)

## The Flavor Chemistry Rules

### Rule 1: Acid/Fat Balance
- Heavy on fats/oils? → **Must add acid** (lemon, vinegar)
- Rich, creamy dish? → **Brighten with acid** post-cook

### Rule 2: Layer Your Seasonings
1. **Before pressure:** Salt, garlic powder, onion powder, dried herbs, umami sources
2. **After pressure:** Fresh herbs, black pepper, acids, finishing salt

### Rule 3: Flavor Profile Consistency
- **Mediterranean:** Oregano, garlic, lemon, red wine vinegar
- **Tex-Mex:** Cumin, chili powder, lime, cilantro
- **Italian:** Oregano, basil, garlic, balsamic/tomato
- **Asian:** Soy sauce, ginger, garlic, rice vinegar

**Don't mix profiles** - If making Italian, don't add cumin. If making Tex-Mex, don't add balsamic.

### Rule 4: The Late-Stage Drizzle
Always finish with:
- Fresh acid (lemon/lime/vinegar)
- Fresh herbs (if available)
- Fresh black pepper
- Finishing salt (if needed)
