# The Bachelor's Flavor Chemistry Guide

## Core Spice Categories

### Universal Base Spices
These work in almost any savory dish:

- **Garlic Powder** - Umami base, use 1-2 tsp per pound of protein
- **Onion Powder** - Sweetness and depth, pairs with garlic
- **Oregano** - Mediterranean base, works in Italian, Mexican, Greek
- **Paprika** - Color and mild heat, use for visual appeal
- **Black Pepper** - Add post-cook for brightness (grounds during pressure cooking)
- **Salt** - Always layer: some during cooking, some at finish

### Heat Spices
- **Cayenne** - Pure heat, use sparingly (1/4-1/2 tsp)
- **Chili Powder** - Heat + flavor (cumin, garlic, oregano blend)
- **Red Pepper Flakes** - Texture + heat, add post-cook

### Earthy/Warm Spices
- **Cumin** - Survives pressure cooking, essential for Tex-Mex/Middle Eastern
- **Coriander** - Citrusy, pairs with cumin
- **Chili Powder** - Blend of cumin, paprika, garlic, oregano

### Fresh vs. Dried
- **Dried herbs** (oregano, thyme, rosemary) - Add before pressure cooking
- **Fresh herbs** (cilantro, parsley, basil) - Add post-cook as garnish/drizzle

## Acids: The Brightness Factor

### When to Use Acids
- **After cooking** - Acids brighten and cut through fat
- **Heavy/fatty dishes** - Always pair with acid
- **Bland dishes** - Acid wakes up flavors

### Common Acids

| Acid | Flavor Profile | Best For | When to Add |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lemon Juice** | Bright, citrusy | Mediterranean, chicken, fish | Post-cook |
| **Lime Juice** | Sharp, tropical | Mexican, Thai, Tex-Mex | Post-cook |
| **Apple Cider Vinegar** | Mild, slightly sweet | Versatile, chicken, vegetables | Post-cook |
| **Red Wine Vinegar** | Bold, tangy | Italian, Mediterranean | Post-cook |
| **Balsamic Vinegar** | Sweet, complex | Italian, roasted vegetables | Post-cook |
| **White Wine Vinegar** | Clean, sharp | Delicate dishes | Post-cook |

### Acid Substitution Guide
- **No lemon?** → Apple cider vinegar + pinch of sugar
- **No lime?** → Lemon juice (slightly different but works)
- **No balsamic?** → Red wine vinegar + pinch of sugar
- **No vinegar?** → Lemon/lime juice (more acidic, use less)

## Umami: The Depth Factor

### What is Umami?
The "savory" taste that adds depth and richness. Think: meaty, brothy, satisfying.

### Umami Sources

| Source | Flavor | Best For | When to Add |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Worcestershire Sauce** | Complex, savory | Beef, chicken, marinades | During cooking |
| **Soy Sauce** | Salty, savory | Asian, marinades, rice | During cooking |
| **Fish Sauce** | Funky, deep | Thai, Vietnamese | During cooking (sparingly) |
| **Tomato Paste** | Sweet, savory | Italian, stews, rice dishes | Before pressure (sear it) |
| **Mushroom Powder** | Earthy, deep | Vegetarian dishes, rice | During cooking |
| **MSG** | Pure umami | Any savory dish | During cooking (tiny amounts) |

### Umami Substitution Guide
- **No Worcestershire?** → Soy sauce + pinch of sugar + dash of vinegar
- **No soy sauce?** → Worcestershire (different flavor but adds umami)
- **No fish sauce?** → Soy sauce (lacks funk but adds depth)

## The Flavor Chemistry Rules

### Rule 1: Acid/Fat Balance
- Heavy on fats/oils? → **Must add acid** (lemon, vinegar)
- Rich, creamy dish? → **Brighten with acid** post-cook

### Rule 2: Layer Your Seasonings
1. **Before pressure:** Salt, garlic powder, onion powder, dried herbs, umami sources
2. **After pressure:** Fresh herbs, black pepper, acids, finishing salt

### Rule 3: Flavor Profile Consistency
- **Mediterranean:** Oregano, garlic, lemon, red wine vinegar
- **Tex-Mex:** Cumin, chili powder, lime, cilantro
- **Italian:** Oregano, basil, garlic, balsamic/tomato
- **Asian:** Soy sauce, ginger, garlic, rice vinegar

**Don't mix profiles** - If making Italian, don't add cumin. If making Tex-Mex, don't add balsamic.

### Rule 4: The Late-Stage Drizzle
Always finish with:
- Fresh acid (lemon/lime/vinegar)
- Fresh herbs (if available)
- Fresh black pepper
- Finishing salt (if needed)
