## 🚨 What to Worry About (Safety & Quality Check)
**Note:** This section is included in the Initiation Recipe (Chipotle Burrito Bowl). For subsequent recipes, refer to that recipe or use the Quick Diagnosis Flow below.

### Quick Diagnosis Flow
1. **Check smell first** - if funky, throw out immediately
2. **Check color** - pink meat = undercooked, gray/green = spoiled
3. **Check texture** - slimy = spoiled, rubbery = overcooked (but safe)
4. **Check doneness** - meat should be white throughout, no pink
5. **Taste test** - if it tastes off, throw it out

**The Golden Rule:** When in doubt, throw it out. Food poisoning isn't worth the risk.

### Meat: Fully Cooked vs. Funky

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Chicken is white throughout** (no pink) - fully cooked
- **Internal temp 165°F+** (if you have a thermometer)
- **Juices run clear** (not pink/red)
- **Texture is firm** (not rubbery or mushy)
- **Smells normal** (chicken-y, not sour/off)

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Pink/red in center** - undercooked, unsafe
- **Slimy texture** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour/rotten smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Gray/green color** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Undercooked?** Add 2-4 mins HP, 10m NR. Check doneness - if still pink, add more time.
- **Rubbery?** You overcooked or quick-released. Next time: use correct timing, always 10m NR, rest 5 mins.
- **Funky smell?** Don't risk it - throw it out. Check your timing next time.

### Rice: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat (Even If Not Perfect):**
- **Slightly crunchy** - undercooked but edible. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, QR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good for bowls, just softer texture.
- **Socarrat (toasted bottom)** - edible and delicious! Scrape and mix in.

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Burned/black** - inedible, throw out
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Crunchy?** Undercooked. Add 1/4 cup water, 2 mins HP, Quick Release.
- **Mushy?** Overcooked or too much liquid. Next time: use exact liquid amount, check timing.
- **Tracing back:** Check your liquid amount, rice timing, and that you did 10m NR.

### Beans: Edible vs. Weird

**✅ Safe to Eat:**
- **Slightly firm** - undercooked but edible. Add 2-3 mins HP, 15m NR.
- **Slightly mushy** - overcooked but edible. Still good, just softer.
- **Creamy texture** - perfect!

**❌ Throw It Out:**
- **Hard as rocks** - severely undercooked, inedible
- **Moldy** - spoiled, throw out immediately
- **Sour smell** - spoiled, throw out immediately

**🔧 Fix It:**
- **Too firm?** Undercooked. If canned: they're fine, just add more time next time. If dried: didn't soak properly or need more cook time.
- **Too mushy?** Overcooked. Next time: reduce cook time or use canned (no extra time needed).
- **Tracing back:** Canned beans = no extra time. Dried beans = must be soaked first, then 8-10m HP, 15m NR.

### The Golden Rule
**When in doubt, throw it out.** Food poisoning isn't worth the risk. Better to remake than get sick.

### Quick Diagnosis Flow
1. **Check smell first** - if funky, throw out immediately
2. **Check color** - pink meat = undercooked, gray/green = spoiled
3. **Check texture** - slimy = spoiled, rubbery = overcooked (but safe)
4. **Check doneness** - meat should be white throughout, no pink
5. **Taste test** - if it tastes off, throw it out
