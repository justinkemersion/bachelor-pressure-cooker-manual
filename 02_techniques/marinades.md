# Marinade Recipes: The Bachelor's Flavor Arsenal

**Why marinade?** Flavor develops during freezing and thawing. When you're ready to cook, the chicken is already seasoned - no prep needed.

**How to use:** See `02_techniques/bulk_prep_and_freezing.md` for the complete marinade & freeze system.

## 🏆 Pantry Hero Marinade (The All-Purpose Winner)

**Makes enough for 2-3 lbs chicken (8-10 thighs) - scale down for individual portions**

**The Liquid Base:**
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

**The Spices:**
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried thyme (the quiet, sophisticated hero - best herb for chicken and lemon)
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (essential - regular paprika adds little)
- 1/2 tsp cumin (adds earthy, warm depth)
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust for heat)
- **1 tsp salt** ← Don't forget this!
- **1/2 tsp black pepper** ← Don't forget this!

**Chemistry Notes:**
- **Oil (1/2 cup):** Fat base - carries flavors, keeps chicken moist
- **Balsamic (1/4 cup):** High-acid + sweetness - balances richness, adds depth
- **Lemon (2 tbsp):** Bright acid - cuts through fat, adds freshness
- **Worcestershire (1 tbsp):** Umami bomb - depth and savory complexity
- **Thyme (1 tsp):** The quiet, sophisticated hero - best herb for chicken and lemon. Heat-stable, infuses deep into chicken skin. Makes the dish taste "expensive."
- **Smoked Paprika (1/2 tsp):** Flavor powerhouse - not just color. Essential upgrade over regular paprika.
- **Salt + Pepper:** **Critical** - salt brings out all other flavors, pepper adds brightness
- **Spice blend:** Universal profile - works with Italian, Mediterranean, Tex-Mex dishes

**Why This Works:**
- **All pantry staples** - no special ingredients needed
- **Balanced chemistry** - fat, acid, umami, heat all present
- **Versatile** - works with rice bowls, pasta, wraps, salads
- **Scales easily** - divide by 4 for 2-3 thighs (see below)

**⚠️ Important Note: Balsamic Vinegar Steam Smell**
When pressure cooking chicken marinated with Pantry Hero (which contains balsamic vinegar), you may notice a **strong, concentrated acidic smell** as the pressure cooker warms up. **This is completely normal!** The balsamic vinegar creates an intense steam during the pressure build-up phase. Don't panic - this is just the effect of the pressure cooker concentrating the acidic vapors. The end result is delicious, and the smell dissipates once cooking begins. Your food will taste great - this is just a temporary effect during the warm-up phase.

**For Individual Portions (2-3 thighs):**
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1.5 tsp lemon juice
- 3/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 tsp each: garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, thyme
- 1/8 tsp each: smoked paprika, cumin
- Pinch red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper

## Marinade Chemistry: The Basics

### The Four Pillars

Every good marinade needs:

1. **Fat (Oil):** Carries flavors, keeps protein moist
    - Olive oil
    - Avocado oil
    - Canola oil

2. **Acid:** Tenderizes, adds brightness
    - Lemon juice / lime juice
    - Vinegar (balsamic, red wine, rice wine, apple cider)

3. **Umami:** Depth and savory complexity
    - Worcestershire sauce
    - Soy sauce
    - Fish sauce

4. **Salt:** Brings out all other flavors (critical!)
    - Kosher salt
    - Table salt

### The Spice Layer

**Base spices** (almost always):
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Salt + pepper

**Profile spices** (choose based on cuisine):
- **Tex-Mex:** Cumin, chili powder
- **Italian/Mediterranean:** Oregano, **thyme** (the missing link)
- **Asian:** Ginger, soy sauce
- **Universal:** **Smoked paprika** (flavor powerhouse, not just color), red pepper flakes (heat)

### Scaling Tips

**For bulk prep (2-3 lbs / 8-10 thighs):**
- Multiply individual portion by 4
- Mix in large bowl, divide into freezer bags

**For single meal (2-3 thighs):**
- Use individual portion recipes above
- Adjust heat (red pepper flakes) to taste

## Bachelor's Tips

### Spice Packet Shortcut
**Don't have individual spices?** Use spice packets (Taco, Fajita, Italian) + oil + acid. Works great!

### Make Ahead
**Mix marinades in bulk** - store in fridge for 1-2 weeks. Ready when you need them.

### Freezer-Friendly
**All marinades freeze well** - add to chicken in freezer bags, freeze flat. Flavor develops during freezing/thawing.

### Don't Overthink It
**Start with Pantry Hero** - it works with almost everything. Build your collection as you go.
