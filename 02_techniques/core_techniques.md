# Core Pressure Cooker Techniques

## Searing (The Maillard Reaction)

### Why Sear?
- Builds "fond" (browned bits) = deep flavor
- Creates texture contrast
- Prevents rubbery chicken

### How to Sear
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté mode** (High)
2. Add 1-2 tbsp oil (avocado, canola, or olive)
3. Wait for "HOT" indicator
4. Add protein (don't crowd - do in batches if needed)
5. **Don't move it** - Let it brown 2-3 minutes per side
6. Remove protein, deglaze pan with liquid (water, broth, wine)

### When to Skip Searing
- If you're in a rush (but flavor will suffer)
- For delicate proteins (fish, some vegetables)

## Rice Preparation

### The Rinse Rule
**Always rinse rice** - Removes excess starch that causes mushiness

### How to Rinse
1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer
2. Run cold water until water runs clear (30-60 seconds)
3. Shake to drain excess water

### Rice Ratios
- **White rice:** 1:1 (1 cup rice : 1 cup liquid)
- **Brown rice:** 1:1.25 (1 cup rice : 1.25 cups liquid)
- **Liquid options:** Water, broth, or mix (broth adds flavor)

### Critical: Pressure Cooker Liquid Logic
**Pressure cookers are closed systems** - unlike stovetop cooking, almost zero liquid evaporates during the pressurized phase.

**Key Principles:**
- **Minimal evaporation:** You lose maybe 2 tablespoons during release, not cups
- **Proteins add liquid:** Chicken thighs release ~1/4 cup juice as they cook
- **The "1:1 + Splash" Rule:** For sequential cooking (protein then rice), start with 1.75 cups liquid to end with 1.5 cups for rice (1:1 ratio)
- **Too much liquid = mushy rice:** Stick to exact ratios, don't overcompensate for "evaporation"

### Preventing Mushy Rice
- Use exact ratios
- Natural release only (never quick release)
- Don't overcook (follow timing charts)
- Rinse thoroughly

## Bean Preparation

### Canned Beans (Easiest - Use These!)
- **No prep needed** - just drain and rinse
- **Add with rice in Phase 2** - no extra cook time
- **Works with any recipe** - black, pinto, white, kidney, etc.
- **Best for:** Quick meals, no planning required

### Dried Beans (Require Soaking)
**Standard Timing (8-10 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Black beans
- Pinto beans
- White beans (Cannellini)
- Navy beans
- Lima beans

**Longer Timing (10-12 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Kidney beans (slightly longer)

**Much Longer Timing (15-20 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Chickpeas/Garbanzo beans (different timing entirely)

### Bean Soaking Methods
1. **Overnight:** Cover with water, soak 8-12 hours, drain
2. **Quick Soak:** Cover with water, bring to boil, remove from heat, soak 1 hour, drain
3. **Always drain** before pressure cooking

### Bean Notes
- **Canned = convenience** - use when you want no prep
- **Dried = budget-friendly** - but requires planning (soaking)
- **All beans need 15m Natural Release** (longer than rice)
- **Don't mix bean types** with different cook times

## Protein Preparation

### Chicken Cuts & Timing

**Chicken Thighs** (Best for bowls - juiciest)
- **Thawed:** 8-10 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 12-15 mins HP (12m minimum)
- **Why:** Most forgiving, stays juicy, perfect for meal prep
- **Trim excess fat** (optional, but reduces greasiness)
- **Bone-in vs. boneless:** Bone-in adds flavor, boneless is faster

**Chicken Cutlets** (Thin pieces - cook fast!)
- **Thawed:** 4-6 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 8-10 mins HP
- **Why:** Thin pieces cook quickly, but can dry out - watch carefully
- **Best for:** Quick meals, not ideal for meal prep (dries out on reheat)

**Chicken Breast** (Lean but can dry out)
- **Thawed:** 6-8 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 10-12 mins HP
- **Why:** Lean protein, but can become rubbery if overcooked
- **Best for:** When you want leaner option, but thighs are more forgiving

**Chicken Drums** (Bone-in flavor)
- **Thawed:** 10-12 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 12-15 mins HP
- **Why:** Bone-in adds flavor, but takes longer
- **Best for:** When you want bone-in flavor, less ideal for bowls

### Frozen vs. Thawed
- **Thawed:** Faster cook time, better texture
- **Frozen:** Add 4 minutes to thawed time (cutlets/breast/thighs), 2-4 mins for drums
- **Best practice:** Thaw in fridge overnight
- **Always check state** before setting timer

## Pot-in-Pot (PIP) Method

### When to Use
- Cooking rice and protein separately in same pot
- Preventing flavors from mixing during cooking
- Ensuring perfect texture for each component

### How It Works
1. Add 1 cup water to bottom of pot
2. Place trivet/steamer basket
3. Put rice in separate container (oven-safe bowl, silicone container)
4. Place protein in pot (or in separate container)
5. Stack containers if needed
6. Pressure cook (use longer time if needed)

## Deglazing

### Why Deglaze?
- Captures browned bits (fond) = flavor
- Prevents "BURN" error
- Creates base for sauce

### How to Deglaze
1. After searing, remove protein
2. Add 1/4-1/2 cup liquid (water, broth, wine)
3. Scrape bottom with wooden spoon
4. Continue with recipe

## Natural Release vs. Quick Release

### Natural Release (NR)
- **When:** Rice, beans, large cuts of meat
- **Why:** Prevents food from becoming mushy/overcooked
- **How:** Wait 10-15 minutes, then manually release remaining pressure

### Quick Release (QR)
- **When:** Vegetables, delicate proteins, when recipe specifies
- **Why:** Stops cooking immediately
- **How:** Turn valve to venting position immediately

### 10m NR (Hybrid)
- Wait 10 minutes natural release
- Then quick release remaining pressure
- Best of both worlds for many dishes

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage Guidelines
- **Cool quickly:** Don't leave at room temp > 2 hours
- **Portion immediately:** Divide into meal-prep containers
- **Label with date:** Use within 3-4 days

### Universal Microwave Reheating Method
**The Bachelor's Go-To:** Works for all pressure cooker meal prep.

1. **Add moisture:** Splash of **water** (minimum) OR **OJ/broth** (adds flavor)
2. **Cover with lid:** If using original container, **place lid slightly off** (covers but vents - prevents explosion)
3. **Microwave:** **3:30 minutes** on **level 7** (medium-high)
4. **Stir halfway** (if possible) for even heating
5. **Restore "high notes":** Stir in fresh herbs/spices after reheating (oregano, cracked pepper, etc.)

**Why This Works:**
- **Moisture prevents drying** - water minimum, OJ/broth adds flavor
- **Vented lid** prevents pressure buildup (safety) while trapping steam
- **Level 7** prevents rubbery texture (gentler than high)
- **Fresh herbs/spices** restore brightness lost in storage

### Other Reheating Methods
1. **Stovetop:** Add splash of water/broth, heat gently, stir
2. **Oven:** 350°F, covered, 15-20 minutes (add liquid)

### Reheating Tips
- **Rice:** Always add moisture (water/broth/OJ) to prevent drying
- **Chicken:** Reheat gently to avoid rubbery texture
- **Acids:** Add fresh acid after reheating (brightens flavors)
- **Herbs/Spices:** Add fresh after reheating - restores "high notes"

## Preventing Common Failures

### Rubbery Chicken
- **Cause:** Overcooking, not searing, quick release
- **Fix:** Sear first, use correct timing, natural release

### Mushy Rice
- **Cause:** Too much water, overcooking, not rinsing
- **Fix:** Exact 1:1 ratio, rinse thoroughly, natural release

### Weird Bean Consistency
- **Cause:** Undercooking, not soaking, wrong release
- **Fix:** Soak properly, use correct timing, natural release

### Bland Food
- **Cause:** Not layering seasonings, missing acid/umami
- **Fix:** Season during cooking AND after, add acid drizzle
