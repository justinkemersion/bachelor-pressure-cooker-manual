## Searing (The Maillard Reaction)

### Why Sear?
- Builds "fond" (browned bits) = deep flavor
- Creates texture contrast
- Prevents rubbery chicken

### How to Sear
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté mode** (High)
2. **Wait for "HOT" indicator** (critical step!)
3. **Then** add 1-2 tbsp oil (see "Oils for Sautéing" below)
4. Let oil heat 10-15 seconds (should shimmer slightly)
5. Add protein (don't crowd - do in batches if needed)
6. **Don't move it** - Let it brown 2-3 minutes per side
7. Remove protein, deglaze pan with liquid (water, broth, wine)

### Common Searing Mistakes
- ❌ **Moving protein too soon** - wait for crust to form naturally
- ❌ **Crowding the pan** - do in batches if needed for proper browning
- ❌ **Adding oil before "HOT"** - oil breaks down and smokes
- ❌ **Skipping deglazing** - wastes flavor and risks burn error
- ❌ **Using butter for searing** - burns easily, use oil instead

### When to Skip Searing
- If you're in a rush (but flavor will suffer)
- For delicate proteins (fish, some vegetables)

## Oils for Sautéing: The Bachelor's Guide

> **Start here:**  
> If you buy one oil for this book, buy avocado oil.  
> It works for everything and won’t burn.

### The Golden Rule: Heat First, Oil Second
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Always wait for the pan to be HOT before adding oil. This prevents the oil from breaking down and creates better browning.

**Why?** When you add oil to a cold pan, it heats slowly and can start to break down before you even add your food. Adding oil to a hot pan means it heats quickly and evenly, giving you better searing and flavor.

**The Process:**
1. Set Instant Pot to **Sauté (High)**
2. Wait for **"HOT" indicator** (the display will show "HOT")
3. **Then** add your oil
4. Let oil heat **10-15 seconds** (you'll see it shimmer slightly)
5. Add your protein

### Oil Options (Ranked by Ease & Performance)

#### 🏆 Country Crock Avocado Oil (Recommended)
**Why it's great:**
- **High smoke point** - won't burn easily, perfect for high-heat searing
- **Neutral flavor** - doesn't overpower your food
- **Easy to find** - available at most grocery stores
- **Good value** - often cheaper than pure avocado oil
- **Works for everything** - searing, sautéing, drizzling

**Best for:** All-purpose searing, especially when you want neutral flavor

**How to use:** 1-2 tbsp for searing 4 chicken thighs

---

#### Avocado Oil (Pure)
**Why it's great:**
- **Highest smoke point** - can handle very high heat
- **Neutral flavor** - clean taste
- **Healthy fats** - monounsaturated

**Best for:** High-heat searing, when you want the best performance

**Note:** More expensive than Country Crock version, but pure avocado oil

---

#### Canola Oil
**Why it's great:**
- **High smoke point** - handles heat well
- **Neutral flavor** - doesn't interfere with spices
- **Budget-friendly** - usually the cheapest option
- **Versatile** - works for searing, baking, everything

**Best for:** Budget-conscious cooking, all-purpose use

**How to use:** 1-2 tbsp for searing

---

#### Olive Oil (Regular, Not Extra Virgin)
**Why it's good:**
- **Medium-high smoke point** - works for searing
- **Adds flavor** - slight olive taste (can be good or bad depending on dish)
- **Common** - most people have this on hand

**Best for:** When you want a hint of olive flavor, Mediterranean dishes

**⚠️ Important:** Use **regular olive oil** (not extra virgin) for searing. Extra virgin olive oil has a lower smoke point and can burn.

**How to use:** 1-2 tbsp for searing

---

#### Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)
**Why it's limited:**
- **Lower smoke point** - can burn at high heat
- **Expensive** - you're wasting money if you burn it
- **Strong flavor** - can overpower delicate dishes

**Best for:** **Drizzling after cooking** (finishing), not for high-heat searing

**When to use:** Add a drizzle of EVOO after cooking for flavor and fat balance (especially with high-acid drizzles like balsamic)

---

### Quick Reference: Which Oil When?

| Oil Type | Smoke Point | Best For | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Country Crock Avocado** | High | All-purpose searing (recommended) | $ |
| **Pure Avocado Oil** | Very High | High-heat searing | $$ |
| **Canola Oil** | High | Budget-friendly, all-purpose | $ |
| **Regular Olive Oil** | Medium-High | Mediterranean dishes, flavor | $ |
| **Extra Virgin Olive Oil** | Low-Medium | **Drizzling after cooking** (not searing) | $$ |

### Bachelor's Tips

**Start with Country Crock Avocado Oil:**
- It's the sweet spot of price, performance, and availability
- Works for everything you'll need
- No need to overthink it

**The "HOT" Indicator Rule:**
- Always wait for "HOT" before adding oil
- This is the #1 mistake beginners make
- Hot pan + hot oil = better browning

**How Much Oil?**
- **1-2 tbsp** is usually enough for 4 chicken thighs
- Too much oil = greasy food
- Too little oil = sticking and burning

**Can You Reuse Oil?**
- For searing, you usually deglaze with liquid anyway
- If you have leftover oil in the pan, you can use it for the deglazing step
- Don't save and reuse oil multiple times (it breaks down)

**What If You Don't Have Oil?**
- You can sear without oil, but it's harder and can stick
- If desperate, use a tiny bit of butter (but it burns easily)
- Better to skip searing than to burn butter

## Rice Preparation

> **The Golden Rule (Sequential Rice):**  
> Pressure cookers don’t evaporate much, so rice texture is about **ratio + release**, not “eyeballing.”  
> Use the **tested baseline**: **2 cups liquid for 1.5 cups rice**, then **Natural Release**.

### The Rinse Rule
**Always rinse rice** - Removes excess starch that causes mushiness

### How to Rinse (With Visual Cue)
1. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer
2. Run cold water - you'll see **milky/cloudy water** at first
3. Keep rinsing until water is **clear like tap water** (30-60 seconds)
4. Shake to drain excess water

**Why?** The cloudiness is excess starch. Clear water = properly rinsed rice.

### Rice Ratios
- **White rice:** 1:1 (1 cup rice : 1 cup liquid)
- **Brown rice:** 1:1.25 (1 cup rice : 1.25 cups liquid)
- **Liquid options:** Water, broth, or mix (broth adds flavor)

### Critical: Pressure Cooker Liquid Logic
**Pressure cookers are closed systems** - unlike stovetop cooking, almost zero liquid evaporates during the pressurized phase.

**Key Principles:**
- **Minimal evaporation:** You lose maybe 2 tablespoons during release, not cups
- **The "Burn-Proof" 1:1 + Buffer:** For sequential cooking (protein then rice), start with **2 cups liquid** for 1.5 cups rice. This ratio is tested and proven - the initiation recipe uses 2 cups and works perfectly.
- **Rice needs 1.5 cups:** The rice will absorb what it needs (1:1 ratio), and you'll have extra liquid for glazes/sauces
- **Too much liquid = mushy rice:** Stick to exact ratios, don't overcompensate for "evaporation"

### Preventing Mushy Rice
- Use exact ratios
- Natural release only (never quick release)
- Don't overcook (follow timing charts)
- Rinse thoroughly

## Bean Preparation

### Canned Beans (Easiest - Use These!)
- **No prep needed** - just drain and rinse
- **Add with rice in Phase 2** - no extra cook time
- **Works with any recipe** - black, pinto, white, kidney, etc.
- **Best for:** Quick meals, no planning required

### Dried Beans (Require Soaking)
**Standard Timing (8-10 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Black beans
- Pinto beans
- White beans (Cannellini)
- Navy beans
- Lima beans

**Longer Timing (10-12 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Kidney beans (slightly longer)

**Much Longer Timing (15-20 mins HP, 15m NR):**
- Chickpeas/Garbanzo beans (different timing entirely)

### What Does "Soaked" Mean?
**"Soaked" = beans have been rehydrated in water before cooking**

**Why soak?** Dried beans are hard and need water to soften before pressure cooking. Soaking makes them cook faster and more evenly.

**Two Methods:**

**1. Overnight Soak (Easiest - No Work)**
- Put dried beans in large bowl
- Cover with **3-4 inches of water** (beans will expand)
- Let sit **8-12 hours** (overnight is perfect)
- **Drain and rinse** before cooking
- **Best for:** Planning ahead, set it and forget it

**2. Quick Soak (1 Hour - When You Forgot)**
- Put dried beans in pot
- Cover with **3-4 inches of water**
- **Bring to boil**, then **remove from heat**
- **Cover and let sit 1 hour**
- **Drain and rinse** before cooking
- **Best for:** When you forgot to soak overnight

**Important:** Always drain and rinse soaked beans before pressure cooking. Don't use the soaking water - it contains stuff that causes gas.

### Bean Notes
- **Canned = convenience** - use when you want no prep
- **Dried = budget-friendly** - but requires planning (soaking)
- **All beans need 15m Natural Release** (longer than rice)
- **Don't mix bean types** with different cook times

## Protein Preparation

### Quick Reference: Chicken Timing

| Cut | Thawed | Frozen | Best For |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Thighs** | 8-10m HP | 12-15m HP | Bowls, meal prep (most forgiving) ⭐ |
| **Breast** | 6-8m HP | 10-12m HP | Lean option (can dry out) |
| **Cutlets** | 4-6m HP | 8-10m HP | Quick meals (not ideal for prep) |
| **Drums** | 10-12m HP | 12-15m HP | Bone-in flavor (less practical) |

**All times assume:** High Pressure + 10m Natural Release  
**⭐ Recommended for beginners** - most forgiving

### Chicken Cuts & Timing (Detailed)

**Chicken Thighs** (Best for bowls - juiciest)
- **Thawed:** 8-10 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 12-15 mins HP (12m minimum)
- **Why:** Most forgiving, stays juicy, perfect for meal prep
- **Trim excess fat** (optional, but reduces greasiness)
- **Bone-in vs. boneless:** Bone-in adds flavor, boneless is faster

**Chicken Cutlets** (Thin pieces - cook fast!)
- **Thawed:** 4-6 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 8-10 mins HP
- **Why:** Thin pieces cook quickly, but can dry out - watch carefully
- **Best for:** Quick meals, not ideal for meal prep (dries out on reheat)

**Chicken Breast** (Lean but can dry out)
- **Thawed:** 6-8 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 10-12 mins HP
- **Why:** Lean protein, but can become rubbery if overcooked
- **Best for:** When you want leaner option, but thighs are more forgiving

**Chicken Drums** (Bone-in flavor)
- **Thawed:** 10-12 mins HP
- **Frozen:** 12-15 mins HP
- **Why:** Bone-in adds flavor, but takes longer
- **Best for:** When you want bone-in flavor, less ideal for bowls

### Frozen vs. Thawed
- **Thawed:** Faster cook time, better texture
- **Frozen:** Add 4 minutes to thawed time (cutlets/breast/thighs), 2-4 mins for drums
- **Best practice:** Thaw in fridge overnight
- **Always check state** before setting timer

## Pot-in-Pot (PIP) Method

### When to Use
- Cooking rice and protein separately in same pot
- Preventing flavors from mixing during cooking
- Ensuring perfect texture for each component
- **Single-serving rice bowls** - cooking rice in a bowl on trivet with steam (see `03_recipes/simple_rice_bowl.md`)

### How It Works
1. Add 1 cup water to bottom of pot
2. Place trivet/steamer basket
3. Put rice in separate container (oven-safe bowl, silicone container)
4. Place protein in pot (or in separate container)
5. Stack containers if needed
6. Pressure cook (use longer time if needed)

---

## Deglazing

### Why Deglaze?
- Captures browned bits (fond) = concentrated flavor
- Prevents "BURN" error by releasing stuck bits
- Creates flavorful base for cooking liquid
- **The fond is where the flavor lives** - don't waste it!

### How to Deglaze
1. After searing, remove protein and set aside
2. **Keep pot on Sauté mode** (you want heat)
3. Add **1/4-1/2 cup liquid** (water, broth, wine, beer)
4. **Scrape bottom vigorously** with wooden spoon - you should see brown bits dissolving
5. Continue with recipe (liquid is now flavored)

**Liquids ranked by flavor impact:**
- **Water** - neutral, just releases fond
- **Broth** - adds depth
- **Wine/Beer** - adds complexity and acidity
- **Vinegar** - too acidic for deglazing (save for drizzle)

---

## Natural Release vs. Quick Release

> **This matters more than timing.**  
> If you use the wrong release, the food will be wrong — even if the cook time was perfect.

### Natural Release (NR)
- **When:** Rice, beans, large cuts of meat
- **Why:** Prevents food from becoming mushy/overcooked
- **How:** Wait 10-15 minutes, then manually release remaining pressure

### Quick Release (QR)
- **When:** Vegetables, delicate proteins, when recipe specifies
- **Why:** Stops cooking immediately
- **How:** Turn valve to venting position immediately

### 10m NR (Hybrid)
- Wait 10 minutes natural release
- Then quick release remaining pressure
- Best of both worlds for many dishes

### What Happens If You Get It Wrong?

**Used QR when you should've used NR:**
- **Rice** → **Mushy**, blown-out texture
- **Beans** → **Split skins**, mushy interior
- **Chicken** → **Rubbery** texture, juices spray everywhere
- **Safety:** Hot liquid can spray from valve

**Used NR when you should've used QR:**
- **Vegetables** → Overcooked, mushy
- **Delicate proteins** → Dried out
- **Not dangerous, just quality suffers**

**When in doubt:** Use NR - it's safer and prevents texture issues

## Storage & Reheating

### Storage Guidelines
- **Cool quickly:** Don't leave at room temp > 2 hours
- **Portion immediately:** Divide into meal-prep containers
- **Label with date:** Use within 3-4 days
- **Container choice:** Glass (Rubbermaid Brilliance) preferred - microwave-safe, no staining
- **Vented lids:** Essential for safe reheating

**See `02_techniques/meal_prep_storage.md` for complete container guide**

### Universal Microwave Reheating Method
**The Bachelor's Go-To:** Works for all pressure cooker meal prep.

**This method is detailed in the Initiation Recipe** (`03_recipes/chipotle_burrito_bowl.md`).

1. **Add moisture:** Splash of **water** (prevents drying)
2. **Cover with lid:** If using original container, **place lid slightly off** (covers but vents - prevents explosion)
3. **Microwave:** **3:30 minutes** on **level 7** (medium-high)
4. **Stir halfway** (if possible) for even heating
5. **Restore "high notes":** Stir in fresh herbs/spices after reheating (oregano, cracked pepper, etc.)

**Why This Works:**
- **Moisture prevents drying** - water prevents food from drying out during reheating
- **Vented lid** prevents pressure buildup (safety) while trapping steam
- **Level 7** prevents rubbery texture (gentler than high)
- **Fresh herbs/spices** restore brightness lost in storage

### Other Reheating Methods
1. **Stovetop:** Add splash of water/broth, heat gently, stir
2. **Oven:** 350°F, covered, 15-20 minutes (add liquid)

### Reheating Tips
- **Rice:** Always add moisture (water) to prevent drying
- **Chicken:** Reheat gently to avoid rubbery texture
- **Acids:** Add fresh acid after reheating (brightens flavors)
- **Herbs/Spices:** Add fresh after reheating - restores "high notes"

## Preventing Common Failures

### Rubbery Chicken
- **Cause:** Overcooking, not searing, quick release
- **Fix:** Sear first, use correct timing, natural release

### Mushy Rice
- **Cause:** Too much water, overcooking, not rinsing
- **Fix:** Exact 1:1 ratio, rinse thoroughly, natural release

### Weird Bean Consistency
- **Cause:** Undercooking, not soaking, wrong release
- **Fix:** Soak properly, use correct timing, natural release

### Bland Food
- **Cause:** Not layering seasonings, missing acid/umami
- **Fix:** Season during cooking AND after, add acid drizzle
