# Meal Prep Storage: The Container Strategy

**The Logic:** Your meal prep is only as good as the vessel you store it in. If the container leaks in your bag or stains permanently orange after one batch of chili, you won't use it.

## 🏆 The "Home Base" Standard (Glass)

**Recommendation:** **Rubbermaid Brilliance (Glass) - 3.2 Cup Medium**

Since you are eating these at home and using the **microwave reheating method** (see `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method), this is the superior choice.

### Why Glass?

*   **The "Vented Latch" Advantage:** These lids have latches that flip up to reveal steam vents.
    *   *The Hack:* You don't need to set the lid "askew." Keep the lid clicked on, but **flip the grey latches UP**. This steams the food perfectly without exploding sauce all over the microwave.
*   **Stain Proof:** The taco seasoning, chipotle peppers, and tomato bases in this cookbook will stain plastic. They wipe right off glass.
*   **The "Real Bowl" Factor:** Eating out of glass feels like a meal; eating out of plastic feels like leftovers.
*   **Durable:** Glass lasts forever - no warping, no staining, no smell retention.

### ⚠️ The Shopping Trap

**Avoid "Variety Sets."** They usually include 2 Medium containers (useful) and 2 Small containers (useless for main meals). Buy **"Medium" (3.2 Cup)** packs specifically.

## 🎒 The "Commuter" Standard (Lightweight)

**Recommendation:** **Rubbermaid Brilliance (Plastic / Tritan) - 3.2 Cup Medium**

If you are taking this to the office, gym, or traveling, glass is too heavy and risky. You want the **Tritan Plastic** version of the exact same container.

### Why Tritan Plastic?

*   **Stain-Resistant:** It is made of Tritan, which is significantly more stain-resistant than cheap "takeout style" plastic. It resists the "Orange Ring of Death" from burrito bowls.
*   **Leakproof:** The gasket seal is tight enough to hold soup. It will not leak in a gym bag.
*   **Microwave Safe:** It handles heat better than cheap plastic (won't warp easily), though for longevity, glass is still better.
*   **Stackability:** These stack perfectly with the glass versions in your fridge.
*   **Lightweight:** Easy to carry, won't break if dropped.

## 🛑 The "Do Not Buy" List

### Cheap "Meal Prep" Black Plastic Tubs
*   **Why avoid:** They crack after 3 washes, the lids pop off in bags, and they retain the smell of the previous meal forever. False economy.
*   **The trap:** They look like a good deal, but you'll replace them constantly.

### Stainless Steel Tins
*   **Why avoid:** Great for camping, but **useless for this cookbook**. You cannot use the microwave reheating method with metal. You would have to dump the food onto a plate, creating extra dishes.
*   **The problem:** Defeats the purpose of meal prep convenience.

### Bamboo Lids
*   **Why avoid:** Aesthetic for Instagram, but you can't microwave them and they warp in the dishwasher.
*   **The reality:** Form over function - not practical for daily use.

## 📏 The Golden Ratio

**3.2 Cups (approx 750ml):** This is the magic volume. It fits:
*   1.5 cups Rice
*   1 cup Chicken
*   0.5 cup Beans/Veg
*   Room for shaking/mixing

**Why this size?** It's the perfect portion for one meal, with enough room to mix without spilling. Too small = cramped, too large = looks empty and wasteful.

## 💡 Bachelor's Tips

**Start with 3-4 containers:**
- This gives you enough for meal prep rotation
- You can always buy more later
- Don't over-invest until you know you'll use them

**Mix and match:**
- 2-3 glass containers for home use
- 1-2 plastic (Tritan) for on-the-go
- They stack together perfectly in the fridge

**Label everything:**
- Use masking tape or labels
- Date + contents (e.g., "Chipotle Bowl - 1/15")
- Prevents mystery food in the back of the fridge

**The vented latch trick:**
- This is the secret weapon for microwave reheating
- No more exploded sauce or soggy food
- Works with the microwave reheating method perfectly

## Storage Guidelines

### Cooling
- **Cool quickly:** Don't leave at room temp > 2 hours
- **Portion immediately:** Divide into meal-prep containers while still warm (easier to portion)
- **Label with date:** Use masking tape or labels - write date + contents (e.g., "Chipotle Bowl - 1/15")
- **Prevents mystery food:** You'll know what it is and when to use it

### Refrigeration
- **Storage time:** Use within **3-4 days** maximum
- **Container choice:** See recommendations above (Glass for home, Tritan for on-the-go)
- **Vented lids:** Essential for safe reheating (allows steam to escape)

### Freezing
- **Individual portions:** Portion into individual zip lock bags (quart size)
- **Label everything:** Write date + contents on bag with permanent marker
- **Freeze flat:** Place bags on baking sheet, freeze flat (prevents sticking, saves space)
- **Storage time:** Use within **2-3 months** for best quality

## Universal Reheating Method

**The Bachelor's Go-To:** Works for all pressure cooker meal prep.

**This method is detailed in** `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` (Universal Microwave Reheating Method).

### Steps
1. **Add moisture:** Splash of **water** (prevents drying)
2. **Cover with lid:** If using original container, **place lid slightly off** (covers but vents - prevents explosion)
   - **Pro tip:** If using Rubbermaid Brilliance, flip the grey latches UP (vents steam perfectly)
3. **Microwave:** **3:30 minutes** on **level 7** (medium-high)
4. **Stir halfway** (if possible) for even heating
5. **Restore "high notes":** Stir in fresh herbs/spices after reheating (oregano, cracked pepper, etc.)

### Why This Works
- **Moisture prevents drying** - water prevents food from drying out during reheating
- **Vented lid** prevents pressure buildup (safety) while trapping steam
- **Level 7** prevents rubbery texture (gentler than high)
- **Fresh herbs/spices** restore brightness lost in storage

### Alternative Reheating Methods
- **Stovetop:** Add splash of water/broth, heat gently in pan, stir occasionally
- **Oven:** 350°F, covered, 15-20 minutes (add liquid)

## Reheating Tips by Component

### Rice
- **Always add moisture** (water) to prevent drying
- Rice can dry out in the fridge - the water splash restores moisture
- Stir halfway for even heating

### Chicken
- **Reheat gently** to avoid rubbery texture (Level 7, not high)
- Add moisture to prevent drying
- Restore with fresh herbs/spices after reheating

### Acids
- **Add fresh acid after reheating** (brightens flavors)
- Lemon/lime juice, vinegar - add after reheating, not before
- Restores the "brightness" lost in storage

### Herbs/Spices
- **Add fresh after reheating** - restores "high notes"
- Dried oregano, thyme, cracked black pepper - add after reheating
- Pressure cooking and storage dulls these flavors - fresh addition restores them

## Burrito/Taco Conversion

**Universal Tip:** Any bowl can become a burrito or taco!

### Method
1. **Warm a tortilla:** 20 seconds in microwave (or heat in dry pan)
2. **Add bowl contents:** Spoon your bowl onto the tortilla
3. **Wrap it up:** Fold and roll
4. **Works for ALL recipes** in this cookbook

### Freezing Burritos
1. **Cool filling first:** Let bowl contents cool before wrapping
2. **Wrap in tortilla:** Add filling, wrap tightly
3. **Place in zip lock bag:** Label with date
4. **Freeze flat:** Place on baking sheet, freeze flat (prevents sticking)
5. **Reheating:** Remove from bag, wrap in **damp paper towel**, microwave **2-3 mins** (flip halfway)
   - **The paper towel trick:** Absorbs excess moisture so tortilla stays soft, not soggy
