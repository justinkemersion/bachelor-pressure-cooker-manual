# Meal Prep Storage: The Container Strategy

**The Logic:** Your meal prep is only as good as the vessel you store it in. If the container leaks in your bag or stains permanently orange after one batch of chili, you won't use it.

## 🏆 The "Home Base" Standard (Glass)

**Recommendation:** **Rubbermaid Brilliance (Glass) - 3.2 Cup Medium**

Since you are eating these at home and using the **microwave reheating method** (see `02_techniques/core_techniques.md` for universal reheating method), this is the superior choice.

### Why Glass?

*   **The "Vented Latch" Advantage:** These lids have latches that flip up to reveal steam vents.
    *   *The Hack:* You don't need to set the lid "askew." Keep the lid clicked on, but **flip the grey latches UP**. This steams the food perfectly without exploding sauce all over the microwave.
*   **Stain Proof:** The taco seasoning, chipotle peppers, and tomato bases in this cookbook will stain plastic. They wipe right off glass.
*   **The "Real Bowl" Factor:** Eating out of glass feels like a meal; eating out of plastic feels like leftovers.
*   **Durable:** Glass lasts forever - no warping, no staining, no smell retention.

### ⚠️ The Shopping Trap

**Avoid "Variety Sets."** They usually include 2 Medium containers (useful) and 2 Small containers (useless for main meals). Buy **"Medium" (3.2 Cup)** packs specifically.

## 🎒 The "Commuter" Standard (Lightweight)

**Recommendation:** **Rubbermaid Brilliance (Plastic / Tritan) - 3.2 Cup Medium**

If you are taking this to the office, gym, or traveling, glass is too heavy and risky. You want the **Tritan Plastic** version of the exact same container.

### Why Tritan Plastic?

*   **Stain-Resistant:** It is made of Tritan, which is significantly more stain-resistant than cheap "takeout style" plastic. It resists the "Orange Ring of Death" from burrito bowls.
*   **Leakproof:** The gasket seal is tight enough to hold soup. It will not leak in a gym bag.
*   **Microwave Safe:** It handles heat better than cheap plastic (won't warp easily), though for longevity, glass is still better.
*   **Stackability:** These stack perfectly with the glass versions in your fridge.
*   **Lightweight:** Easy to carry, won't break if dropped.

## 🛑 The "Do Not Buy" List

### Cheap "Meal Prep" Black Plastic Tubs
*   **Why avoid:** They crack after 3 washes, the lids pop off in bags, and they retain the smell of the previous meal forever. False economy.
*   **The trap:** They look like a good deal, but you'll replace them constantly.

### Stainless Steel Tins
*   **Why avoid:** Great for camping, but **useless for this cookbook**. You cannot use the microwave reheating method with metal. You would have to dump the food onto a plate, creating extra dishes.
*   **The problem:** Defeats the purpose of meal prep convenience.

### Bamboo Lids
*   **Why avoid:** Aesthetic for Instagram, but you can't microwave them and they warp in the dishwasher.
*   **The reality:** Form over function - not practical for daily use.

## 📏 The Golden Ratio

**3.2 Cups (approx 750ml):** This is the magic volume. It fits:
*   1.5 cups Rice
*   1 cup Chicken
*   0.5 cup Beans/Veg
*   Room for shaking/mixing

**Why this size?** It's the perfect portion for one meal, with enough room to mix without spilling. Too small = cramped, too large = looks empty and wasteful.

## 💡 Bachelor's Tips

**Start with 3-4 containers:**
- This gives you enough for meal prep rotation
- You can always buy more later
- Don't over-invest until you know you'll use them

**Mix and match:**
- 2-3 glass containers for home use
- 1-2 plastic (Tritan) for on-the-go
- They stack together perfectly in the fridge

**Label everything:**
- Use masking tape or labels
- Date + contents (e.g., "Chipotle Bowl - 1/15")
- Prevents mystery food in the back of the fridge

**The vented latch trick:**
- This is the secret weapon for microwave reheating
- No more exploded sauce or soggy food
- Works with the microwave reheating method perfectly
