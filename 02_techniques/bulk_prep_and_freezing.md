# Bulk Prep & Freezing: The Bachelor's Meal Prep System

## The $10 Chicken Strategy

### The Problem
You bought **~$10 worth of chicken thighs** (usually 2-3 lbs), used a quarter for tonight's meal, now you have **6-8 thighs left**. What do you do?

### The Solution: Marinade & Freeze in Portions

**Why this works:**
- **Flavor develops** during freezing and thawing
- **Ready to cook** when you need it - no prep required
- **Portion control** - each bag = one meal
- **Variety** - different marinades = different meal options
- **Saves money** - buy in bulk, use over time

---

## The Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Divide into Portions
- **2-3 thighs per bag** = one meal (with rice/veggies)
- **Use freezer bags** (quart size works well)
- **Remove excess fat** if desired (optional)

### Step 2: Prepare Marinades
Choose 2-3 different flavor profiles for variety:

**See `02_techniques/marinades.md` for complete marinade recipes** (includes the 🏆 Pantry Hero - the all-purpose winner!)

### Step 3: Add to Bags
1. **Place chicken** in freezer bag
2. **Add marinade** (2-3 tbsp per bag)
3. **Seal most of the way** - leave small opening
4. **Remove air** - squeeze out or use straw trick:
   - Insert straw, seal around it
   - Suck out air
   - Remove straw while sealing
5. **Label clearly:**
   - Flavor profile (e.g., "Tex-Mex")
   - Date frozen
   - Number of pieces

### Step 4: Freeze Flat
- **Lay bags flat** on baking sheet
- **Freeze until solid** (2-3 hours)
- **Stack vertically** in freezer (saves space, easy to see)
- **Thaws faster** when flat

## Thawing Methods

### Method 1: Refrigerator (Best)
- **Place bag in fridge** the night before
- **Thaws in 12-24 hours** (depending on size)
- **Safest method** - maintains food safety
- **Plan ahead** - requires thinking ahead

### Method 2: Cold Water (Fast)
- **Place sealed bag** in large bowl of cold water
- **Change water every 30 minutes**
- **Thaws in 1-2 hours**
- **Keep water cold** - don't use warm/hot water

### Method 3: Cook from Frozen
- **Add 2-4 minutes** to cook time (see timing charts)
- **Can't sear first** - skip searing step
- **Works fine** - slightly longer cook time
- **Convenient** - no planning required

## Using Frozen Marinaded Chicken

### When Thawed
1. **Remove from bag** (marinade stays on)
2. **Pat dry** if searing (helps browning)
3. **Cook as normal** - follow recipe
4. **Marinade flavor is already there** - no extra seasoning needed
5. **Still add acid post-cook** - brightens flavors

### When Frozen
1. **Add directly to pot** (no searing possible)
2. **Add 2-4 minutes** to pressure cook time
3. **Marinade will melt** and flavor the dish
4. **Still add acid post-cook** - essential

## Other Bulk Prep Ideas

### Frozen Vegetables
- **Portion large bags** into smaller freezer bags
- **Pre-measured amounts** - ready to use
- **No waste** - use what you need

### Canned Goods
- **Canned chilis** - portion into ice cube trays, freeze, transfer to bags
- **Tomato paste** - freeze in tablespoon portions
- **Broth** - freeze in 1-cup portions

### Rice
- **Cook extra rice** - freeze in portions
- **Reheat with splash of water** - good as fresh
- **Saves time** on future meals

## Storage Guidelines

### Freezer Storage Times
- **Raw chicken (marinaded):** 3-6 months (best quality)
- **Cooked chicken:** 2-3 months
- **Cooked rice:** 1-2 months
- **Frozen vegetables:** 8-12 months

### Labeling System
**Format:** `[Flavor] - [Date] - [Qty]`

Examples:
- `Tex-Mex - 12/15/24 - 3 thighs`
- `Italian - 12/15/24 - 2 thighs`
- `Asian - 12/20/24 - 3 thighs`

### Organization
- **Stack vertically** - easy to see what you have
- **Group by flavor** - or by date (oldest in front)
- **Use freezer inventory** (optional) - track what's in there

## The Bachelor's Freezer Setup

### Ideal Freezer Organization
```
Top Shelf:    Ready-to-cook marinaded chicken (various flavors)
Middle Shelf: Frozen vegetables, portioned
Bottom Shelf: Cooked meal prep, canned goods (frozen portions)
Door:         Spice packets, small items
```

### Rotation System
- **First in, first out** - use oldest items first
- **Check monthly** - clean out forgotten items
- **Label everything** - no guessing games

## Benefits of This System

1. **Saves money** - buy in bulk, portion yourself
2. **Saves time** - ready-to-cook when you need it
3. **Reduces waste** - use what you need, freeze the rest
4. **Adds variety** - different marinades = different meals
5. **Builds confidence** - always have something ready to cook
6. **Meal prep made easy** - no massive Sunday prep sessions
